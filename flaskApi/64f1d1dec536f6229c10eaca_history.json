Each level builds upon the previous one and has specific rules and guidelines for organizing and minimizing redundancy in database tables.\n\n1. First Normal Form (1NF):\n   - The data is organized into tables where each column contains atomic values (indivisible).\n   - There are no repeating groups of columns.\n\n2. Second Normal Form (2NF):\n   - The data meets the requirements of 1NF.\n   - All non-key attributes depend on the entire primary key, and there are no partial dependencies.\n\n3. Third Normal Form (3NF):\n   - The data meets the requirements of 2NF.\n   - There are no dependencies between non-key columns (transitive dependencies).\n\nIt's important to note that beyond 3NF, there are additional levels of normalization like Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) and Fourth Normal Form (4NF), which are more advanced and typically covered in higher-level database courses.\n\nFor further details and examples on each level of normalization, you can search the following queries on Google to find relevant resources and explanations:\n- \"First Normal Form (1NF) in database normalization\"\n- \"Second Normal Form (2NF) in database normalization\"\n- \"Third Normal Form (3NF) in database normalization\"\n\nI hope this clarifies the different levels of normalization for you.
