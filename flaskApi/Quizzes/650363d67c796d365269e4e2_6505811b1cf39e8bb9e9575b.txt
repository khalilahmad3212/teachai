2. The constant rule states that the derivative of a constant is always zero.
3. The derivative of a sum or difference of functions is equal to the sum or difference of their derivatives.
4. The product rule is used to find the derivative of a product of two functions.
5. The quotient rule is used to find the derivative of a quotient of two functions.
6. The chain rule is used to find the derivative of composite functions.
7. The derivative of a constant times a function is equal to the derivative of the function multiplied by the constant.
8. The derivative of a constant times a function is equal to the derivative of the constant multiplied by the function.
9. The derivative of a constant to the power of a function is equal to the derivative of the function divided by the logarithm of the constant.
