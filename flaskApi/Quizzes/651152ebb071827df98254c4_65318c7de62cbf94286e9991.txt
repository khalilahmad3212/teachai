Here is your quiz, Derivation: True or False.

1. The derivative of a constant function is always zero.
2. The power rule states that if y = x^n, where n is a constant, then dy/dx = n * x^(n-1).
3. The derivative of a sum of two functions is equal to the sum of their derivatives.
4. The constant multiple rule states that if y = k * f(x), where k is a constant, then dy/dx = k * f'(x).
5. The derivative of a product of two functions is equal to the derivative of the first function multiplied by the second function, plus the derivative of the second function multiplied by the first function.
6. The quotient rule states that if y = f(x) / g(x), then dy/dx = (f'(x) * g(x) - f(x) * g'(x)) / (g(x))^2.
7. The chain rule states that if y = f(g(x)), then dy/dx = f'(g(x)) * g'(x).

15. The derivative of a logarithmic function log_a(x) is equal to (1/x) * (1/ln(a)).
16. The derivative of a constant times a function raised to a power is equal to the constant times the power times the function raised to the power minus one.
