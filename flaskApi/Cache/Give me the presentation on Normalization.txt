#Slide: 4
#Header: Introduction to Normalization
#Content: 
- Definition: Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. 
- Goal: Eliminate data anomalies and ensure data is stored efficiently and accurately.
- Key concept: Breaking down large tables into smaller, more manageable tables.

#Slide: 5
#Header: Purpose of Normalization
#Content: 
- Remove data redundancy: Avoid storing the same data in multiple places.
- Eliminate data anomalies: Prevent update, insertion, and deletion anomalies.
- Ensure data consistency: Maintain data integrity and accuracy.
- Simplify data management: Make it easier to query and update the database.

#Slide: 6
#Header: Benefits of Normalization
#Content: 
- Improved data integrity
- Reduced data redundancy
- Increased database efficiency
- Enhanced data consistency
- Simplified data management
- Improved query performance

#Slide: 7
#Header: Normal Forms
#Content: 
- Normal forms define the rules for organizing data in a normalized database.
- Each normal form has a specific set of requirements that a database must meet to be considered normalized.
- The level of normalization increases with each subsequent normal form.

#Slide: 8
#Header: First Normal Form (1NF)
#Content: 
- Eliminate duplicate columns within a table.
- Create a primary key to uniquely identify each row.
- Use atomic values to store data in fields.

#Slide: 9
#Header: Second Normal Form (2NF)
#Content: 
- Meet all the requirements of 1NF.
- Remove partial dependencies by creating separate tables for related data.
- Use foreign keys to establish relationships between tables.

#Slide: 10
#Header: Third Normal Form (3NF)
#Content: 
- Meet all the requirements of 2NF.
- Remove transitive dependencies by creating separate tables for non-key attributes.
- Each non-key attribute should depend only on the primary key.

#Slide: 11
#Header: Fourth Normal Form (4NF)
#Content: 
- Meet all the requirements of 3NF.
- Remove multi-valued dependencies by creating separate tables for multi-valued attributes.
- Each table should represent a single entity or relationship.

#Slide: 12
#Header: Fifth Normal Form (5NF)
#Content: 
- Meet all the requirements of 4NF.
- Remove join dependencies by decomposing tables into smaller, more specialized tables.
- Each table should have a single purpose and not be redundant.

#Slide: 13
#Header: Summary
#Content: 
- Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.
- The purpose of normalization is to eliminate data anomalies and ensure consistent and accurate data.
- Benefits of normalization include improved data integrity, reduced redundancy, and simplified data management.
- There are five normal forms, each with specific requirements to ensure database normalization.
