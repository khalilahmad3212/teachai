#Header: Introduction to Derivation
#Content: Derivation is a fundamental concept in calculus that allows us to find the rate of change of a function at any point. It helps us understand how functions behave and enables us to solve various mathematical and real-world problems.

#Slide: 5
#Header: Understanding the Derivative
#Content: The derivative of a function represents its rate of change. It is denoted by f'(x) or dy/dx. The derivative measures the slope of the tangent line to a function at a specific point.

#Slide: 6
#Header: Rules of Differentiation
#Content: There are several rules to find the derivative of a function, including the power rule, constant rule, product rule, quotient rule, and chain rule. These rules provide a systematic approach to differentiation.

#Slide: 7
#Header: Derivative of Basic Functions
#Content: The derivative of basic functions such as constant functions, linear functions, quadratic functions, square root functions, and reciprocal functions can be found using the rules of differentiation.

#Slide: 8
#Header: Derivative of Trigonometric Functions
#Content: Trigonometric functions like sine, cosine, tangent, cotangent, secant, and cosecant have specific derivatives. Learning these derivatives helps in finding the rate of change of trigonometric functions.

#Slide: 9
#Header: Derivative of Exponential and Logarithmic Functions
#Content: Exponential and logarithmic functions have their own derivatives, which are crucial in understanding exponential growth and decay, as well as solving problems involving logarithmic functions.

#Slide: 10
#Header: Derivative of Composite Functions
#Content: Composite functions involve chaining multiple functions together. The chain rule provides a method to find the derivative of composite functions.

#Slide: 11
#Header: Applications of Derivation
#Content: Derivation has numerous applications in various fields such as physics, economics, biology, and engineering. It helps in solving optimization problems, determining maximum and minimum values, and analyzing rates of change.
