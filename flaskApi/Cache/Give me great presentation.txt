#Slide: 4
#Header: Overview of Derivation
#Content: Derivation is the process of finding the rate at which a quantity is changing. It is commonly used in mathematics and physics to analyze functions and calculate gradients or slopes.

#Slide: 5
#Header: Rules for Derivation
#Content: 
- Power Rule: Derivative of a constant multiplied by a variable raised to a power is the product of the constant, the power, and the variable raised to the power minus one.
- Sum Rule: Derivative of a sum or difference of two functions is the sum or difference of their derivatives.
- Product Rule: Derivative of a product of two functions is the first function times the derivative of the second function, plus the second function times the derivative of the first function.
- Chain Rule: Derivative of a composition of two functions is the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function.
