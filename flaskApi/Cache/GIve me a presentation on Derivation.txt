#Header: Introduction to Derivation
#Content: - Definition: Derivation is a mathematical process of finding the rate at which a function is changing at a specific point.
- It is used to calculate the slope or rate of change of a function.
- Derivation is an essential concept in calculus.

#Slide: 5
#Header: Why is Derivation Important?
#Content: - Derivation helps analyze the behavior of functions.

#Slide: 6
#Header: Basic Concepts of Derivation
#Content: - Derivative: The derivative of a function represents the rate of change of the function at a specific point.
- Slope: The derivative of a function gives the slope of the tangent line at a particular point.
- Notation: The derivative of a function f(x) is denoted as f'(x) or dy/dx.

#Slide: 7
#Header: Rules of Derivation
#Content: - Power Rule: Differentiating x^n gives nx^(n-1).
- Product Rule: Differentiating (f(x) * g(x)) gives f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x).
- Chain Rule: Differentiating composite functions requires applying the chain rule.
- Quotient Rule: Differentiating (f(x) / g(x)) requires using the quotient rule.
