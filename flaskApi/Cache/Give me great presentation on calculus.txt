#Header: Functions and Limits
#Content: Functions are mathematical relationships that map inputs to outputs. Limits describe the behavior of a function as the input approaches a certain value. They enable us to analyze properties of functions, such as continuity and differentiability.

#Slide: 8
#Header: Differentiation
#Content: Differentiation is the process of finding the derivative of a function, which represents its rate of change at any given point. It is used to analyze the behavior of functions, such as finding maximum and minimum points.

#Slide: 9
#Header: Integration
#Content: Integration involves finding the area under a curve or the accumulated change over an interval. It is used to solve problems related to finding areas, volumes, and accumulations of quantities.
