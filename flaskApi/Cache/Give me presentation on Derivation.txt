#Header: Introduction to Derivation
#Content: - Derivation is a fundamental concept in calculus that involves finding the rate at which a function changes.
- The derivative of a function represents this rate of change at any point on the graph.
- The derivative allows us to analyze the behavior of functions and solve various mathematical problems.

#Slide: 5
#Header: Key Concepts in Derivation
#Content: - Slope of a tangent line
- Instantaneous rate of change
- Increasing and decreasing functions
- Critical points and extrema

#Slide: 6
#Header: Notation and Formulas
#Content: - Derivatives are typically denoted using the prime notation (f'(x), dy/dx, etc.).
- The power rule, product rule, quotient rule, and chain rule are commonly used formulas in derivation.

#Slide: 7
#Header: Rules of Differentiation
#Content: - Power Rule: Derivative of x^n is nx^(n-1)
- Product Rule: (f * g)' = f' * g + f * g'
- Quotient Rule: (f/g)' = (f'g - fg') / g^2
- Chain Rule: (f(g(x)))' = f'(g(x)) * g'(x)
