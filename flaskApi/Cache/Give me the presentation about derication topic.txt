#Header: Introduction to Derivation
#Content: Derivation is a fundamental concept in calculus that involves finding the rate at which a function changes at any given point. It allows us to calculate slopes, rates of change, and optimize functions.

#Slide: 5
#Header: Basic Derivative Rules
#Content: The basic derivative rules include:
- Constant Rule
- Power Rule
- Exponential Rule
- Sum/Difference Rule
- Product Rule
- Quotient Rule

#Slide: 6
#Header: The Power Rule
#Content: The power rule states that if we have a function f(x) = cx^n, the derivative is given by f'(x) = n * cx^(n-1). This rule is used to find the derivative of functions with powers or exponents.

#Slide: 7
#Header: The Product Rule
#Content: The product rule states that if we have two functions u(x) and v(x), the derivative of their product is given by (u * v)' = u'v + uv'. This rule is applied when we have a product of two functions.

#Slide: 8
#Header: The Quotient Rule
#Content: The quotient rule states that if we have two functions u(x) and v(x), the derivative of their quotient is given by (u / v)' = (u'v - uv') / v^2. This rule is used when we have a quotient of two functions.

#Slide: 9
#Header: The Chain Rule
#Content: The chain rule is used to find the derivative of composite functions. It states that if we have a composition of two functions f(g(x)), the derivative is given by f'(g(x)) * g'(x). This rule is useful when functions are nested within each other.

#Slide: 10
#Header: Examples
#Content: Here are some examples where we can apply the derivative rules to find the derivative of functions and solve problems involving rates of change and optimization.

#Slide: 11
#Header: Applications of Derivation
#Content: Derivation has numerous applications in real-world scenarios, such as physics, economics, and engineering. We can use it to determine maximum and minimum points, optimize processes, and analyze rates of change.
