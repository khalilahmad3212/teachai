#Header: Introduction to Derivation
#Content: - Derivation is a fundamental concept in calculus
- It allows us to find the rate at which a function is changing at any given point
- The derivative measures the slope of the function at a specific point

#Slide: 5
#Header: Basic Derivative Rules
#Content: - Power Rule: d/dx(x^n) = nx^(n-1)
- Constant Rule: d/dx(c) = 0
- Sum and Difference Rule: d/dx(f(x) +/- g(x)) = f'(x) +/- g'(x)

#Slide: 6
#Header: Derivative of a Polynomial Function
#Content: - For a polynomial function, the derivative of each term is computed individually using the power rule
- Example: f(x) = 3x^2 + 2x + 1
- f'(x) = 6x + 2

#Slide: 7
#Header: Derivative of Trigonometric Function
#Content: - Different trigonometric functions have specific derivative rules
- Examples: 
    - sin(x) has derivative cos(x)
    - cos(x) has derivative -sin(x)
    - tan(x) has derivative sec^2(x)

#Slide: 8
#Header: Chain Rule
#Content: - The chain rule is used to compute the derivative of composite functions
- It involves taking the derivative of the outer function and multiplying it with the derivative of the inner function

#Slide: 9
#Header: Derivative of Exponential Function
#Content: - The derivative of e^x is e^x
- The general rule is: d/dx(e^(kx)) = k*e^(kx)

#Slide: 10
#Header: Derivative of Logarithmic Function
#Content: - The derivative of ln(x) is 1/x
- The general rule is: d/dx(ln(kx)) = 1/kx

#Slide: 11
#Header: Derivative of Product and Quotient
