#Header: Introduction to Derivation
#Content: 
- Derivation is a fundamental concept in calculus.
- It involves finding the rate at which a function is changing at a specific point.
- Derivatives provide information about the slope, or rate of change, of a function.

#Slide: 5
#Header: The Derivative Function
#Content: 
- The derivative of a function is denoted as f'(x) or dy/dx.
- It represents the rate of change of the function with respect to x.
- The derivative function allows us to find the slope of a curve at any given point.

#Slide: 6
#Header: Basic Derivative Rules
#Content: 
- Power Rule: To find the derivative of x^n, multiply by the exponent and reduce the exponent by 1.
- Constant Multiple Rule: The derivative of a constant times a function is equal to the constant times the derivative of the function.
- Sum and Difference Rule: The derivative of the sum or difference of two functions is equal to the sum or difference of the derivatives of the functions.

#Slide: 7
#Header: Differentiation Techniques
#Content: 
- Product Rule: The derivative of the product of two functions is obtained by differentiating each function and then adding them.
- Quotient Rule: The derivative of the quotient of two functions is obtained by differentiating the numerator and denominator separately.
- Chain Rule: The derivative of a composite function is obtained by multiplying the derivative of the outer function with the derivative of the inner function.

#Slide: 8
#Header: Derivatives of Trigonometric Functions
#Content: 
- The derivatives of common trigonometric functions such as sine, cosine, and tangent have specific formulas.
- These formulas allow us to find the derivatives of trigonometric functions without going through the limit definition of a derivative.

#Slide: 9
#Header: Applications of Derivatives
#Content: 
- Derivatives have numerous applications in real-life problems.
- They can be used to find maximum or minimum values, optimize functions, and solve related rates problems.
- Examples include finding the minimum cost for a fence, maximizing the volume of a box, and determining the rate at which two objects are moving away from each other.
