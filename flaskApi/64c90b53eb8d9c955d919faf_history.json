Resource: Khan Academy Videos\n   - Search on Google: \"Khan Academy Derivatives\"\n   - Khan Academy offers a comprehensive series of videos on derivatives, including topics such as basic rules, chain rule, implicit differentiation, and related rates. The videos provide clear explanations and examples to help students understand the concept of derivation.\n\n2. Activity: Differentiation Stations\n   - Divide the class into small groups and set up stations with different problems related to derivation.\n   - Each station can focus on a different aspect of differentiation, such as finding derivatives of polynomial functions, trigonometric functions, or exponential functions.\n   - Provide worksheets or cards with problems at each station and encourage students to work together to solve them.\n   - Rotate the groups between stations, allowing students to gain practice with a variety of differentiation problems.\n\n3. Resource: Calculus Made Easy by Silvanus P. Thompson\n   - Search on Google: \"Calculus Made Easy pdf\"\n   - This classic resource offers an accessible introduction to calculus concepts, including derivation. The book provides plain-English explanations and step-by-step examples to help students grasp the fundamentals of differentiation.\n\n4. Activity: Derivative Scavenger Hunt\n   - Create a set of questions that require students to find derivatives of different types of functions.\n   - Place the questions around the classroom or school, assigning a unique identifier to each question.\n   - Divide the class into small groups and give each group a starting question.\n   - Once a group finds the answer, they search for the next question that matches the identifier provided.\n   - The scavenger hunt continues until all questions have been answered. This activity promotes active learning and engages students in real-life problem-solving.\n\nRemember to tailor these resources and activities according to your specific learning objectives and students' needs."}, {"role": "user", "content": "As a helpful assistant for teachers, your task is to provide relevant resources and activities for lesson planning, focusing on the subject, grade level, and learning objectives.
