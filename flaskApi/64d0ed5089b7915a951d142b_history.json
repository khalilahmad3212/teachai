Video: \"Introduction to Derivatives\" by Khan Academy - This video provides a clear introduction to the concept of derivatives, explaining how to find derivatives of basic functions and how to interpret them.\n\n3. Online Article: \"Understanding Derivatives\" - This article offers a detailed explanation of the concept of differentiation, providing examples and clarifying common misconceptions.\n\nActivities:\n1. Derivative Practice Problems: Provide students with a set of practice problems encompassing different types of functions, such as polynomial, exponential, and trigonometric functions. Students can work individually or in groups to solve these problems, applying the rules of differentiation.\n\n2. Real-World Applications: Engage students by presenting real-world examples where derivatives are used, such as finding the rate of change, optimization problems, or calculating slopes of curves. Students can work in pairs or small groups to analyze and solve these application problems.\n\n3. Graphical Analysis: Distribute a set of functions graphically represented on coordinate planes. Students can use the derivative concept to analyze the behavior of these functions and determine their rates of change at various points.\n\nRemember, for each resource or video, please search on Google using the provided title or description to access them as I cannot provide direct links.
