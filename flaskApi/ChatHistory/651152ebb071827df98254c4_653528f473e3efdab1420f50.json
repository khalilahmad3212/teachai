True or False: Arithmetic is a branch of mathematics that deals with the properties and manipulation of numbers. (True)\n\n2. True or False: In arithmetic, addition is a commutative operation, meaning that changing the order of the numbers being added does not affect the sum. (True)\n\n3. True or False: The arithmetic mean, also known as the average, is the sum of a set of numbers divided by the count of those numbers. (True)\n\n4. True or False: Subtraction is the inverse operation of addition, where the minuend is reduced by the subtrahend to get the difference. (True)\n\n5. True or False: Multiplication is a distributive operation, meaning that the product of two numbers multiplied by a third number is the same as multiplying each factor separately and then adding the products. (False)\n\n6. True or False: In arithmetic, the division of two numbers can result in a quotient, a remainder, or both. (True)\n\n7. True or False: Exponents are used in arithmetic to represent repeated multiplication of the base number. (False)\n\n8. True or False: The order of operations in arithmetic, also known as PEMDAS, stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, and Subtraction. (True)\n\n9. True or False: The absolute value of a number is its distance from zero on the number line, always resulting in a positive value. (False)\n\n10. True or False: In arithmetic, the least common multiple (LCM) is the smallest integer that is divisible by two or more numbers. (True)\n\n11. True or False: Operations in arithmetic are always associative, meaning that changing the grouping of numbers being operated does not affect the final result. (False)\n\n12. True or False: The arithmetic progression is a sequence of numbers in which the difference between any two consecutive terms is always the same. (True)\n\nPlease note that the solutions are provided in parentheses after each statement.\nI hope this quiz serves as a helpful resource for your students.
