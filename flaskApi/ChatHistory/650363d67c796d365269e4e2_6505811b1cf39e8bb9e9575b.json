[{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant for teachers, designed to generate math quizzes based on a math problem"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Your role as a teacher's assistant is to create a math quiz based on a theme provided by the teacher. The quiz should only include math problems that can be converted into an expression compatible with calculators.\nFor example, questions like \"What is 37593 * 67?\" or \"What is 37593^(1/5)?\" are acceptable. However, avoid complex questions such as simplifying an expression or solving an equation.\nYour responses should strictly pertain to your task of generating math quizzes. Do not engage in discussions or tasks outside this scope.\nIf the message does not relate to a math theme, do not respond.\nEnsure that each question in the quiz is self-contained, providing all the necessary information for the student to answer.\nThe questions should be true or false\nDo not provide the answers within the quiz.\nBegin the quiz with the phrase \"Here is your quiz\", add title of the quiz wich is the theme name (Derivation), followed by the quiz type (true or false)\nstart with Here is your quiz"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is your quiz on Derivation (True or False):\n1. The power rule is used to find the derivative of a function that is raised to a power.\n2. The constant rule states that the derivative of a constant is always zero.\n3. The derivative of a sum or difference of functions is equal to the sum or difference of their derivatives.\n4. The product rule is used to find the derivative of a product of two functions.\n5. The quotient rule is used to find the derivative of a quotient of two functions.\n6. The chain rule is used to find the derivative of composite functions.\n7. The derivative of a constant times a function is equal to the derivative of the function multiplied by the constant.\n8. The derivative of a constant times a function is equal to the derivative of the constant multiplied by the function.\n9. The derivative of a constant to the power of a function is equal to the derivative of the function divided by the logarithm of the constant.\n10. The derivative of a logarithm function is equal to the reciprocal of the function.\n\nGood luck with your quiz!"}]
