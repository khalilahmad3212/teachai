She explains that native speakers often use a different form of the language in everyday life, which is different from the English taught in textbooks or schools. To help with this, she offers some tips and also mentions a free PDF resource that includes a quiz and vocabulary to further assist learners. The video emphasizes the importance of understanding the differences in spoken English and provides strategies to overcome these challenges. In this video, the speaker explains how spoken English can be different from textbook English. They give the example of their mother trying to speak English to their Spanish boyfriend, using idioms, phrasal verbs, and changing pronunciation, which was quite funny. The speaker goes on to discuss how certain grammar rules might be more commonly used in writing than in spoken language, such as the passive voice. They also mention that native speakers often end sentences with prepositions, despite being taught otherwise. The speaker also points out that certain phrases, like \"I haven't got any money,\" are commonly used in spoken British English, whereas in school, learners are taught to say \"I don't have any money.\" In this video, the speaker discusses three tips for mastering English. The first tip is about dropping the subject in expressions like \"can't believe it\" and using contractions like \"cannot.\" The second tip is to get feedback from trained professionals, and the speaker recommends a language tutor platform called language talk. The speaker also offers a $10 credit for signing up and taking a lesson. The third tip is about connected speech and how native speakers tend to squish words together for efficient communication. In this video, the speaker discusses connected speech in British English. They mention several key aspects, including elision (omission of certain sounds), assimilation (sounds changing to become more like neighboring sounds), intrusive \"r\" (insertion of an \"r\" sound between vowel sounds), linking \"r\" (pronouncing an \"r\" when a word ending in \"r\" is followed by a word beginning with a vowel sound), and weak forms (reduced pronunciations of certain words, especially function words). The speaker provides examples and explains how these features contribute to a more efficient and fluid pronunciation in spoken British English. This video provides a quick overview of connected speech and the use of contractions in spoken English. The speaker explains that contractions are the shortening of words by combining two or more words and are commonly used by native speakers. Examples of common contractions are given, such as \"I'm,\" \"we're,\" \"can't,\" and \"don't.\" The video also mentions informal contractions, which are used in casual conversations and can cause confusion for English learners. Lastly, the importance of learning idioms and slang to understand native speakers is emphasized. In this video, the speaker discusses the use of slang and idioms in the English language. While English speakers often use slang and idioms to add color and character to their speech, it can be challenging for English learners to understand. The speaker provides examples of common slang terms such as \"grub\" for food and \"fit\" to mean attractive. They also mention idioms like \"knackered\" for extremely tired and \"chuffed\" for very happy. The speaker suggests downloading a PDF for more idioms and slang phrases, and offers to make a dedicated video on the topic if viewers are interested. The video is a language lesson where the speaker provides tips and advice. They mention an accompanying PDF that will be helpful, as well as an offer on a platform called Langotalk. They encourage viewers to check out their B1, B2, and C1 programs if they are serious about improving their English. The speaker ends by saying goodbye and promising another lesson soon.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In this video, the speaker discusses the difficulties that English learners face when trying to understand native speakers.
