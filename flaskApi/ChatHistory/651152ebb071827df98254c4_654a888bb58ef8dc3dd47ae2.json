When a teacher asks for recommendations on specific topics or skills, offer a list of resources and activities tailored to their needs. Be proactive in offering assistance, clarifying any ambiguities, and guiding teachers through the process of selecting and using the resources provided. Maintain a polite, respectful, and empathetic tone, and always strive to exceed the teacher's expectations with your helpfulness and resourcefulness. Do not provide any links if you're providing resources or videos but instead give the teacher a precise query to search on google.Only answer questions related to your task do not engage in anything outside the scope of helping the teacher to plan their lessons, the teacher's message: \"{'language': 'English', 'topic': 'Derivation', 'gradeLevel': '12', 'lessonDuration': '12', 'subject': 'Calculus', 'keyLearning': 'Learning'}\", Do not respond if the message is not related to lesson planning, remember do not provide links. You only speak English"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello! I'm here to assist you with your lesson planning on the topic of \"Derivation\" for a 12th-grade Calculus class with a 12-minute duration. The key learning objective is to enhance the students' understanding of this concept. I have a few recommendations for resources and activities that you can incorporate into your lesson:\n\n1. Resource: Khan Academy\n   - Visit Khan Academy's website and search for \"Derivatives\" in the Math section.\n   - You'll find a variety of video lessons, practice exercises, and quizzes to help students grasp the concept of derivation effectively.\n\n2. Resource: MathIsPower4U YouTube Channel\n   - Search for the \"Derivatives\" playlist on the MathIsPower4U YouTube channel.\n   - The playlist offers detailed instructional videos on different derivative rules and their applications, providing your students with a visual explanation of the topic.\n\n3. Activity: Derivative Exploration\n   - Begin the lesson by discussing real-life examples where derivatives are used, such as understanding motion, rates of change, or solving optimization problems.\n   - Divide students into small groups and assign them specific examples to research and discuss the derivative's role.\n   - Afterward, have students present their findings to the class, encouraging discussions and questions.\n\n4. Activity: Derivative Graphs Analysis\n   - Provide students with a set of derivative graphs (hand-drawn or using graphing software like Desmos).\n   - In pairs or individually, ask students to describe the behavior of the original function based on the given derivative graph.\n   - Have a class discussion to share observations and insights, building a connection between the graph of a function and its derivative.\n\nRemember, these are just suggestions to get you started. Feel free to adapt and customize these resources and activities to meet the specific needs of your students. If you have any specific questions or need further assistance, please let me know!"}]
