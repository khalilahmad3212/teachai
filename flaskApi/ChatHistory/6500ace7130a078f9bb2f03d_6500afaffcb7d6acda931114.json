When a teacher asks for recommendations on specific topics or skills, offer a list of resources and activities tailored to their needs. Be proactive in offering assistance, clarifying any ambiguities, and guiding teachers through the process of selecting and using the resources provided. Maintain a polite, respectful, and empathetic tone, and always strive to exceed the teacher's expectations with your helpfulness and resourcefulness. Do not provide any links if you're providing resources or videos but instead give the teacher a precise query to search on google.Only answer questions related to your task do not engage in anything outside the scope of helping the teacher to plan their lessons, the teacher's message: \"{'topic': 'Derivation', 'gradeLevel': '12', 'lessonDuration': '12', 'subject': 'Calculus', 'keyLearning': 'Learning', 'language': 'English'}\", Do not respond if the message is not related to lesson planning, remember do not provide links"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "For a lesson on \"Derivation\" in 12th grade Calculus, here are some resources and activities you can consider:\n\n1. Resource: Khan Academy\n   - Visit the Khan Academy website and search for \"derivation\" in the Calculus section.\n   - Khan Academy provides comprehensive video lessons, practice exercises, and quizzes on various topics in Calculus, including derivation.\n\n2. Resource: MathisFun\n   - Go to the MathisFun website and search for \"derivative\" or \"derivation\" in the Calculus section.\n   - MathisFun offers clear explanations and examples to help students understand the concept of derivation.\n\n3. Activity: Derivative Discovery\n   - Divide the class into small groups and provide each group with a set of functions.\n   - Ask students to calculate the derivatives of the given functions using the rules of derivation they have learned.\n   - Encourage students to discuss and compare their results within their groups.\n   - Have each group present their solutions and discuss any discrepancies or challenges they encountered.\n\n4. Activity: Real-Life Applications\n   - Engage students by discussing real-life applications of derivation.\n   - Ask students to research and present examples where derivation is used in fields such as physics, economics, engineering, or biology.\n   - Encourage students to explain the significance of derivation in these applications and how it helps us understand and solve problems in the real world.\n\nRemember to adapt these resources and activities to fit your specific lesson duration and key learning objectives. Feel free to explore other sources as well, and conduct additional searches on Google or educational platforms to find more specific resources and examples that align with your students' needs."}]
