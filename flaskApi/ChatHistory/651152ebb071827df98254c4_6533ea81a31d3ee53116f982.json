They also mention that native speakers often end sentences with prepositions, despite being taught otherwise. They provide examples of how spoken English may differ from textbook English, emphasizing the importance of understanding these differences when communicating with native speakers. In this video, the speaker discusses three tips for mastering the English language. The first tip is about dropping the subject in certain expressions, such as \"can't believe it,\" where the contraction of \"cannot\" is used. The second tip is to seek feedback from trained professionals, like those on the language tutoring platform Language Talk, to improve your language skills. The speaker also mentions a promotion where viewers can receive $10 in lesson credits if they sign up for Language Talk and take their first lesson. The third tip is about connected speech, where native English speakers tend to squash words together to communicate more quickly and efficiently. Overall, the video provides helpful tips for those looking to improve their English proficiency. In this video, the speaker discusses different aspects of connected speech in British English. They start by mentioning \"elision,\" which is the omission of certain sounds in speech to make pronunciation more efficient. The most common example in British English is dropping the final sound in words like \"not,\" \"but,\" and \"what.\" The speaker then talks about \"assimilation,\" where a sound changes to become more like a neighboring sound. In British English, this often happens with the T and D sounds when followed by a \"yeah\" sound. Examples given include \"got you\" and \"would you.\" Next, the speaker discusses the \"intrusive R\" in non-rotic accents, where an R sound is sometimes inserted between two vowel sounds to make the transition smoother. This is particularly common in accents like Received Pronunciation. An example given is pronouncing \"Law and Order\" as \"Lawr and Order.\" Another type of linking sound mentioned is the \"linking R,\" which occurs when a word ending in the letter R is followed by a word beginning with a vowel sound. In non-rotic accents, the R is pronounced to connect the two words. An example given is pronouncing \"far away\" as \"far awayr.\" Lastly, the speaker mentions the concept of weak forms in connected speech. Certain words, especially function words like prepositions, articles, and auxiliary verbs, are often pronounced with a reduced or weak form. The example given is \"to\" being pronounced as a reduced form in connected speech. The video provides an overview of connected speech, contractions, and informal contractions in the English language. It discusses how connected speech and contractions are commonly used by native speakers to shorten words and improve comprehension. It also mentions that informal contractions are popular but can be confusing for English learners. Lastly, the video recommends learning idioms and slang to better understand native speakers. The video discusses the use of slang and idioms in English.

It also mentions idioms like \"dab hand\" for being skilled at something, \"knackered\" for being extremely tired, and \"chuffed\" for feeling very happy or pleased. The speaker offers a PDF with more idioms and slang phrases for further learning.
