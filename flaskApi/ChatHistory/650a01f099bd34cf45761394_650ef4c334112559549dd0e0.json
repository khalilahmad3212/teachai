She mentions that by signing up to her mailing list, viewers will also receive weekly lesson PDFs and updates. The video discusses the differences between spoken English and textbook English. The speaker explains that native English speakers often have a different mindset and may not change their language to adapt to English learners. The video provides examples of how spoken English may differ from grammar rules taught in textbooks, such as the use of passive voice and ending sentences with prepositions. It also mentions that native speakers may bend certain rules, such as saying \"I haven't got any money\" instead of \"I don't have any money.\" The video discusses three tips for mastering English. The first tip is about dropping the subject in certain expressions, such as \"can't believe it.\" The second tip emphasizes the importance of getting feedback from trained professionals, and the video recommends an online language tutor platform called Language Talk. The video offers a $10 lesson credit for signing up and taking the first lesson. The third tip is about connected speech, which refers to native speakers squishing words together to convey information quickly and efficiently. The video discusses various aspects of connected speech in British English. It explains the phenomenon of elision, where certain sounds are omitted to make pronunciation more efficient. It also highlights assimilation, in which a sound changes to become more like a neighboring sound, particularly with the T and D sounds. The video mentions the presence of the intrusive \"r\" in non-rotic accents, where an \"r\" sound is inserted between two vowel sounds for smoother transition. Additionally, it talks about the linking \"r,\" which occurs when a word ending in \"r\" is followed by a word beginning with a vowel sound. The video also touches on weak forms, where certain words are pronounced with a reduced or weak form, especially for function words like prepositions and auxiliary verbs. In this video, the speaker gives a quick overview of connected speech and emphasizes the importance of understanding it for improving comprehension skills. They then discuss contractions, which are shortened words formed by combining two or more words and are commonly used in spoken English. The speaker provides examples of common contractions and mentions the existence of informal contractions used in casual conversations. The video concludes with the suggestion to learn idioms and slang in order to better understand native speakers. In this video, the speaker discusses the use of slang and idioms in the English language. They explain that although English learners may find it challenging to understand slang and idioms, these expressions add color and character to conversations. The speaker then provides examples of common slang terms, such as \"grub\" for food, \"lurgy\" for a mild illness, and \"fit\" to describe someone as attractive. They also mention idioms like \"knackered\" meaning extremely tired and \"chuffed\" meaning very happy.
