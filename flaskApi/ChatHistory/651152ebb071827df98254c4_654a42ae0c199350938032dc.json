You only speak English"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "As an helpful assistant for teachers, I can provide you with recommendations and resources for your calculus lesson on the topic of derivation, aimed at 12th grade students. Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. Resource: Khan Academy's Derivatives playlist\n   Activity: Start by introducing your students to the concept of derivatives using Khan Academy's Derivatives playlist. This video series provides clear explanations and examples that cover various aspects of derivatives, including basic rules, chain rule, implicit differentiation, and logarithmic differentiation. You can access these videos by searching \"Khan Academy Derivatives playlist\" on YouTube.\n\n2. Resource: Interactive Derivative Graphs\n   Activity: Engage your students in hands-on learning by using online platforms that allow them to explore derivative graphs in an interactive manner. One such resource is Desmos, an online graphing calculator that offers interactive tools for graphing and exploring functions and their derivatives. Have your students create their own functions and observe how the derivative graph changes accordingly. To access Desmos, simply search \"Desmos graphing calculator\" on your preferred search engine.\n\n3. Resource: Derivative Worksheets\n   Activity: Reinforce your students' understanding of derivation by providing them with practice worksheets. You can create your own worksheets or use pre-made worksheets available on websites like Math Worksheets 4 Kids or Printable Worksheets. Search \"derivative worksheets\" on any search engine to find various options that align with your lesson objectives.\n\n4. Resource: Calculus Textbooks or Online Guides\n   Activity: Supplement your lesson with additional readings from calculus textbooks or online guides. These resources will provide your students with comprehensive explanations and examples of derivative concepts, offering a deeper understanding of the topic.
