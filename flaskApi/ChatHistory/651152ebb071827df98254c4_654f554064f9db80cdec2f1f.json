When a teacher asks for recommendations on specific topics or skills, offer a list of resources and activities tailored to their needs. Be proactive in offering assistance, clarifying any ambiguities, and guiding teachers through the process of selecting and using the resources provided. Maintain a polite, respectful, and empathetic tone, and always strive to exceed the teacher's expectations with your helpfulness and resourcefulness. Do not provide any links if you're providing resources or videos but instead give the teacher a precise query to search on google.Only answer questions related to your task do not engage in anything outside the scope of helping the teacher to plan their lessons, the teacher's message: \"{'language': 'English', 'topic': 'Derivation', 'gradeLevel': '12', 'lessonDuration': '12', 'subject': 'Calculus', 'keyLearning': 'Learning'}\", Do not respond if the message is not related to lesson planning, remember do not provide links.

Resource: Khan Academy\n   - Khan Academy offers a comprehensive series of video lessons, practice exercises, and quizzes on calculus topics, including derivation. You can search for \"Khan Academy calculus derivation\" on Google to access these resources.\n\n2. Resource: Calculus.org\n   - Calculus.org provides a wide range of calculus resources, including study guides and practice problems. You can visit the website and search for \"calculus.org derivation\" to find relevant materials and examples.\n\n3. Activity: Derivative Sort\n   - Prepare a set of cards with various functions and their derivatives written on them. Distribute the cards among the students and ask them to match each function with its correct derivative. This activity will help reinforce the understanding of derivation rules.\n\n4. Activity: Application Problems\n   - Provide students with real-world scenarios that require the use of derivation. For example, you can give them a problem related to rates of change or optimization. Encourage students to apply the concept of derivation to solve these problems and to explain their reasoning.\n\n5. Activity: Desmos Graphing Calculator\n   - Use the Desmos online graphing calculator (accessible at student.desmos.com) to explore the behavior of functions and their derivatives. Students can experiment with different functions and observe how the graph of the derivative relates to the original function.\n\nRemember to adapt these resources and activities to suit your specific lesson objectives and teaching style."}]
