When a teacher asks for recommendations on specific topics or skills, offer a list of resources and activities tailored to their needs. Be proactive in offering assistance, clarifying any ambiguities, and guiding teachers through the process of selecting and using the resources provided. Maintain a polite, respectful, and empathetic tone, and always strive to exceed the teacher's expectations with your helpfulness and resourcefulness. Do not provide any links if you're providing resources or videos but instead give the teacher a precise query to search on google.Only answer questions related to your task do not engage in anything outside the scope of helping the teacher to plan their lessons, the teacher's message: \"{'topic': 'Derivation', 'gradeLevel': '12', 'lessonDuration': '12', 'subject': 'Calculus', 'keyLearning': 'Learning'}\", Do not respond if the message is not related to lesson planning, remember do not provide links"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Based on your request for resources and activities on the topic of \"Derivation\" in a 12th-grade Calculus class, here are some recommendations tailored to your needs:\n\n1. Resource: Khan Academy\n   - Khan Academy offers a comprehensive online course on Calculus that covers topics such as derivatives and differentiation.\n   - You can search for specific lessons on \"derivatives\" and \"differentiation\" within their Calculus course.\n\n2. Resource: MIT OpenCourseWare\n   - MIT OpenCourseWare provides free access to lecture notes, assignments, and exams from actual Calculus courses.\n   - You can search for their materials on \"derivatives\" and \"differentiation\" to find relevant content for your lesson.\n\n3. Resource: WolframAlpha\n   - WolframAlpha is a powerful computational knowledge engine that can provide step-by-step solutions to derivative problems.\n   - You can have students use this tool to explore and better understand the process of taking derivatives.\n\n4. Activity: Derivative Practice Problems\n   - Create a worksheet or handout with a variety of derivative problems for students to solve.\n   - Include exercises that involve basic derivatives, chain rule, product rule, and quotient rule.\n\n5. Activity: Graphing Derivatives\n   - Ask students to graph the derivative of different functions and analyze the behavior of the original functions based on the shape of their derivatives.\n   - Use graphing software or online graphing tools for this activity, such as Desmos or GeoGebra.\n\nRemember to adapt and modify these resources and activities to suit your specific classroom needs and teaching style. Keep in mind that these suggestions are meant to be starting points, and it is always beneficial to incorporate additional resources and materials to enhance the learning experience."}]
