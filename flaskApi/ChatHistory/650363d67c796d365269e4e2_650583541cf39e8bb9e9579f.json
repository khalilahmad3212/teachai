The speaker explains that spoken English is often different from the English taught in textbooks or schools, particularly in terms of casual everyday language. She offers tips to help overcome this challenge, including exposure to authentic spoken English, practicing listening skills, and learning common expressions and idioms. The video also prompts viewers to download a free PDF with further explanations, a quiz, and bonus vocabulary. Additionally, the speaker mentions that viewers who sign up for the PDF will receive free weekly lesson PDFs, along with other course offers and updates. This video discusses the differences between spoken English and textbook English. The speaker shares examples of how native speakers may deviate from formal grammar rules, such as using the passive voice more frequently in writing than in speech. Additionally, they address the common practice of ending sentences with prepositions, which may be confusing for learners but is commonly used by native speakers. Other examples of bending grammar rules in spoken English are also mentioned, such as using \"I haven't got any money\" instead of \"I don't have any money.\" The video highlights the importance of understanding these differences in order to effectively communicate with native speakers. The video discusses three tips for mastering the English language. The first tip is to understand that in certain expressions, the subject can be dropped and contractions can be used, such as \"can't believe it\" instead of \"I cannot believe it.\" The second tip is to seek feedback from trained professionals, and the video recommends Language Talk, an online language tutor platform. The third tip is to understand connected speech, which refers to how native speakers often squish words together to communicate quickly and efficiently. The video also offers a $10 credit for a lesson on Language Talk for viewers who sign up using a specific code. This video discusses various aspects of connected speech in British English. It highlights features such as elision, assimilation, intrusive \"R,\" linking \"R,\" and weak forms. Elision refers to omitting certain sounds to improve pronunciation efficiency. Assimilation occurs when a sound changes to resemble a neighboring sound. The intrusive \"R\" is sometimes added between two vowel sounds for smoother transitions. The linking \"R\" connects a word ending in \"R\" to a word starting with a vowel sound. Weak forms involve pronouncing certain words with reduced or weaker sounds, commonly seen in function words. The video discusses connected speech and its importance in improving comprehension skills. It explains that contractions are a common aspect of connected speech, where words are shortened by combining them and omitting certain letters. The video provides examples of contractions commonly used by native English speakers. It also mentions informal contractions that are popular but can cause confusion for English learners. The video concludes by emphasizing the importance of learning idioms and slang to better understand native speakers. The video discusses the use of slang and idioms in English, explaining that while they add color and character to conversations, they can also be challenging for English learners to understand. The presenter provides examples of common slang terms such as \"grub\" (unhealthy food) and \"fit\" (attractive), as well as idioms like \"dab hand\" (skilled) and \"knackered\" (exhausted). The video also mentions that slang and idioms can vary between British and American English. The presenter offers a downloadable PDF with more slang and idioms and expresses a willingness to make a dedicated video on the topic if viewers are interested. The video is about a language learning lesson that provides tips to the viewer. The speaker encourages the viewer to download a PDF that is designed to help them and mentions an offer on langotalk, a language learning platform. The speaker also mentions that they have recently launched B1, B2, and C1 programs for those who want to take their English learning seriously.
