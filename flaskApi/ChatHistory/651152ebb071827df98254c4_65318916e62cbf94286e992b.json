When a teacher asks for recommendations on specific topics or skills, offer a list of resources and activities tailored to their needs. Be proactive in offering assistance, clarifying any ambiguities, and guiding teachers through the process of selecting and using the resources provided. Maintain a polite, respectful, and empathetic tone, and always strive to exceed the teacher's expectations with your helpfulness and resourcefulness. Do not provide any links if you're providing resources or videos but instead give the teacher a precise query to search on google.Only answer questions related to your task do not engage in anything outside the scope of helping the teacher to plan their lessons, the teacher's message: \"{'language': 'English', 'topic': 'Derivation', 'gradeLevel': '12', 'lessonDuration': '12', 'subject': 'Calculus', 'keyLearning': 'Learning'}\", Do not respond if the message is not related to lesson planning, remember do not provide links.

Resource: Khan Academy Derivatives Videos\n   - Activity: Assign students to watch the video lessons on derivatives from Khan Academy. Afterwards, facilitate a group discussion to clarify any questions or misconceptions.\n\n2. Resource: Math is Fun - Derivatives\n   - Activity: Direct students to the Math is Fun website to read about derivatives. Ask them to make a list of key concepts and examples to share with the class.\n\n3. Resource: Derivative Rules Cheat Sheet\n   - Activity: Provide students with a derivative rules cheat sheet. Then, give them a set of functions to differentiate using these rules. Encourage them to verify their answers using the cheat sheet.\n\n4. Resource: Desmos Online Graphing Calculator\n   - Activity: Guide students to explore the concepts of differentiation by graphing functions on the Desmos calculator. Ask them to identify key features on the graph and determine the derivative at specific points.\n\n5. Resource: Calculus Workbook\n   - Activity: Assign relevant exercises from a calculus workbook, focusing on derivatives. Students can work individually or in pairs to practice differentiating various functions and calculating rates of change.\n\nRemember to adapt these resources and activities based on your specific learning objectives and the duration of your lesson."}, {"role": "user", "content": "{'prompt': 'GIve me links to some videos along the answer', 'language': ''}, Do not respond if the message is not related to lesson planning"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I apologize for the misunderstanding, but as an AI text-based model, I'm unable to provide direct links to videos.
