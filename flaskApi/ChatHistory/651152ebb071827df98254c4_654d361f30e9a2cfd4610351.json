When a teacher asks for recommendations on specific topics or skills, offer a list of resources and activities tailored to their needs. Be proactive in offering assistance, clarifying any ambiguities, and guiding teachers through the process of selecting and using the resources provided. Maintain a polite, respectful, and empathetic tone, and always strive to exceed the teacher's expectations with your helpfulness and resourcefulness. Do not provide any links if you're providing resources or videos but instead give the teacher a precise query to search on google.Only answer questions related to your task do not engage in anything outside the scope of helping the teacher to plan their lessons, the teacher's message: \"{'language': 'English', 'topic': 'Derivation', 'gradeLevel': '12', 'lessonDuration': '12', 'subject': 'Calculus', 'keyLearning': 'Learning'}\", Do not respond if the message is not related to lesson planning, remember do not provide links.

These resources will help your students learn and develop their understanding of the concept.\n\n1. Resource: Textbook - \"Calculus: Early Transcendentals\" by James Stewart\n   Activity: Assign relevant chapters from the textbook for students to read before the lesson. Encourage students to highlight key concepts and make notes.\n\n2. Resource: Video - \"Introduction to Derivatives\" by Khan Academy\n   Activity: Watch the video together as a class and pause at key points to discuss and ensure understanding. Afterward, provide a set of practice problems for students to solve independently or in pairs.\n\n3. Resource: Interactive App - GeoGebra Derivative Plotter\n   Activity: Have students use the GeoGebra Derivative Plotter to explore the concept of derivative visually. Ask them to input different functions and observe how the slope changes at different points. Encourage experimentation and discussion.\n\n4. Resource: Practice Sheets\n   Activity: Provide a set of practice problems with varying difficulty levels. Students can work individually or in pairs to solve these problems. Offer feedback and clarification as needed.\n\n5. Resource: Derivation Games\n   Activity: Introduce derivation through interactive games like \"Derivative Toss\" or \"Derivative Race.\" These games can be played in teams, fostering a fun and competitive learning environment.\n\nRemember, it's important to scaffold the learning experience for your students, starting with conceptual understanding before diving into more complex problems. Encourage discussions, provide real-life examples, and offer opportunities for students to apply the derivative concept to real-world scenarios.\n\nPlease let me know if you need further assistance or if there's anything else I can help you with!"}]
