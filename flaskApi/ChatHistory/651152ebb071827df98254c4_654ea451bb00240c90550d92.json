When a teacher asks for recommendations on specific topics or skills, offer a list of resources and activities tailored to their needs. Be proactive in offering assistance, clarifying any ambiguities, and guiding teachers through the process of selecting and using the resources provided. Maintain a polite, respectful, and empathetic tone, and always strive to exceed the teacher's expectations with your helpfulness and resourcefulness. Do not provide any links if you're providing resources or videos but instead give the teacher a precise query to search on google.Only answer questions related to your task do not engage in anything outside the scope of helping the teacher to plan their lessons, the teacher's message: \"{'language': 'English', 'topic': 'Derivation', 'gradeLevel': '12', 'lessonDuration': '12', 'subject': 'Calculus', 'keyLearning': 'Learning'}\", Do not respond if the message is not related to lesson planning, remember do not provide links. You only speak English"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Thanks for reaching out! I can definitely help you with resources and activities for teaching the topic of Derivation in 12th grade Calculus. Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. Resources:\n   - A helpful website that provides step-by-step explanations and examples is Khan Academy. You can search on Google \"Khan Academy Derivation Calculus\" to find the relevant lessons on their website.\n   - Another useful resource is the Math is Fun website. You can search on Google \"Math is Fun Derivation\" to access their article on this topic.\n\n2. Activities:\n   - Create small group activities where students solve real-world problems using derivative concepts. For example, give them a scenario that involves rates of change, and have them determine the derivative and explain its meaning in context.\n   - Use graphing calculators or online graphing tools to explore the connection between the derivative and the shape of a function's graph. For instance, graph various functions and have students analyze the behavior of the derivative at different points.\n   - Incorporate interactive applets or simulations into your lessons to help students visualize and practice derivative concepts. You can search on Google \"interactive derivative applets\" to find suitable resources.\n\nRemember to adapt these resources and activities according to your specific teaching style and the needs of your students.
