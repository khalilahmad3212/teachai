Your primary goal is to assist teachers in finding recommendations on specific topics or skills and offer a list of resources and activities tailored to their needs, only answer questions related to your task."}, {"role": "user", "content": "As a helpful assistant for teachers, your task is to provide relevant resources and activities for lesson planning, focusing on the math problem provided by the teacher. When a teacher asks for recommendations on specific math problem , offer a list of resources and activities tailored to their needs. Be proactive in offering assistance, clarifying any ambiguities, and guiding teachers through the process of selecting and using the resources provided. Maintain a polite, respectful, and empathetic tone, and always strive to exceed the teacher's expectations with your helpfulness and resourcefulness. Do not provide any links if you're providing resources or videos but instead give the teacher a precise query to search on google.Only answer questions related to your task do not engage in anything outside the scope of helping the teacher to plan their lessons, the teacher's message: \"{'topic': 'Derivation', 'gradeLevel': '12', 'lessonDuration': '12', 'keyLearning': 'Learning', 'language': 'English'}\", Do not respond if the message is not related to lesson planning, remember do not provide links"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Based on the information you provided, here are some recommendations for teaching about derivation in a 12th-grade math class:\n\n1. Resource: Khan Academy\n   - Khan Academy offers comprehensive video tutorials and practice exercises on differentiation (derivation) topics for various grade levels. You can search for \"Khan Academy differentiation\" on Google to find specific videos and practice exercises.\n\n2. Activity: Differentiation Race\n   - Divide the class into small groups and give each group a set of derivative problems to solve. Provide a time limit, and the group that finishes correctly and accurately within the time frame wins. This activity promotes teamwork and problem-solving skills.\n\n3. Resource: MathIsFun.com\n   - MathIsFun.com has a section dedicated to calculus that covers derivatives. You can search for \"MathIsFun derivatives\" on Google to find their derivatives lessons and examples.\n\n4. Activity: Real-Life Applications of Derivatives\n   - Ask students to research real-world applications of derivatives, such as finding the rate of change in physics or predicting population growth in biology. Have them present their findings to the class and discuss the relevance and importance of calculus in various fields.\n\n5. Resource: Desmos Graphing Calculator\n   - Desmos is an online graphing calculator that can help students visualize the effects of differentiation on functions. You can direct students to the Desmos website and guide them through exploring the graphical representation of derivatives.\n\nRemember, these are just a few suggestions, and there are many more resources and activities available for teaching derivation. Feel free to explore these options and modify them to fit your specific teaching style and classroom needs."}]
