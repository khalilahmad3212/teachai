She explains that spoken English is different from textbook or school English, and that native speakers often use casual, everyday language in their conversations. The presenter offers tips to help overcome this challenge and suggests downloading a free PDF with detailed explanations and a quiz to test understanding. She also mentions the opportunity to join her mailing list to receive free weekly lesson PDFs and updates. In this video, the speaker talks about how spoken English and textbook English can differ. They give examples of grammar differences, such as the use of passive voice, ending sentences with prepositions, and bending other grammar rules. The speaker also mentions how native speakers may have difficulty adapting their language to non-native English learners. They share a personal anecdote about their mother trying to converse with a non-English speaking boyfriend. Overall, the video highlights the differences between spoken and written English and the challenges non-native speakers may face when encountering native speakers. The video discusses three tips for mastering English. The first tip is about dropping the subject in expressions like \"can't believe it\" by using contractions. The video explains that although we are taught to always include the subject, in conversation, it's common to drop it. The second tip suggests getting feedback from trained professionals to truly master the language. The video recommends Language Talk, an online language tutor platform with high-quality teachers across all languages. The video also offers a $10 lesson credit for signing up and taking the first lesson. The third tip talks about connected speech, where native speakers tend to squish words together to convey information quickly and efficiently. The video notes that this can be observed while listening to British content or talking with native English speakers. The video ends by encouraging viewers to check the description box for the link to Language Talk and to find their perfect fit for a tutor. In this video, the speaker discusses various aspects of connected speech in British English. They mention that one common feature is the omission of certain sounds, especially the final sound in words like \"not\" and \"but.\" They also talk about assimilation, where sounds change to become more like neighboring sounds, particularly with the T and D sounds followed by a \"yeah\" sound. The speaker then introduces the concept of the intrusive \"r,\" where an \"r\" sound is inserted between two vowel sounds to create a smoother transition. They also discuss the linking \"r,\" which occurs when a word ending in \"r\" is followed by a word beginning with a vowel sound. Lastly, they talk about weak forms, which are often used for function words like prepositions, articles, and auxiliary verbs in connected speech. The video provides a quick overview of connected speech and the importance of understanding it for improved comprehension skills. It introduces the concept of contractions as a form of connected speech, where words are shortened by combining two or more words and replacing certain letters with an apostrophe. Native speakers commonly use contractions in spoken English. The video also mentions informal contractions, which are more casual and can cause confusion for English learners. Finally, the video suggests learning idioms and slang as they are essential for understanding native speakers. In this video, the speaker discusses the use of slang and idioms in English. They explain that while slang and idioms add color and character to the language, they can also make it challenging for English learners to understand. The speaker provides examples of common slang terms, such as \"grub\" for food, \"lurgy\" for feeling unwell, and \"fit\" for attractive. They also mention idioms like \"knackered\" for extremely tired and \"chuffed\" for very happy. The speaker offers a PDF with more slang and idioms for those interested in learning further. They express their enjoyment in teaching slang and idioms and suggest making a dedicated video if there is enough interest. In this video, the speaker concludes the lesson and provides some additional tips. They mention a PDF link that is designed to help viewers, as well as an offer on a platform called Langotalk. The speaker encourages viewers to take advantage of a discount code for Langotalk and to enroll in their first lesson and send the code to the support team. The speaker also mentions that B1, B2, and C1 programs have been launched recently, and encourages viewers to check them out if they are serious about improving their English. The video ends with the speaker saying goodbye and mentioning that there will be another lesson in the future.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In this video, the presenter discusses the challenges that English learners face in understanding native speakers and offers tips to overcome this difficulty.
