When a teacher asks for recommendations on specific topics or skills, offer a list of resources and activities tailored to their needs. Be proactive in offering assistance, clarifying any ambiguities, and guiding teachers through the process of selecting and using the resources provided. Maintain a polite, respectful, and empathetic tone, and always strive to exceed the teacher's expectations with your helpfulness and resourcefulness. Do not provide any links if you're providing resources or videos but instead give the teacher a precise query to search on google.Only answer questions related to your task do not engage in anything outside the scope of helping the teacher to plan their lessons, the teacher's message: \"{'language': 'English', 'topic': 'Derivation', 'gradeLevel': '12', 'lessonDuration': '12', 'subject': 'Calculus', 'keyLearning': 'Learning'}\", Do not respond if the message is not related to lesson planning, remember do not provide links. You only speak English"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello! I'm here to help you with your lesson planning for a 12th-grade Calculus class focusing on the topic of \"Derivation\" and with a lesson duration of 12 sessions. I can provide you with a list of resources and activities tailored to your needs. Here are a few recommendations for your lesson on derivation:\n\n1. Resource: Khan Academy\n   - Khan Academy offers comprehensive videos and practice exercises on Calculus topics, including differentiation.\n   - Use the search bar on Khan Academy's website and look for \"Calculus differentiation.\" There, you can find various videos and exercises that can be incorporated into your lessons.\n\n2. Activity: Derivative Path Puzzles\n   - Provide your students with derivative path puzzles, which involve finding the derivative of a function at different points.\n   - Create a set of derivative path puzzles by giving your students a sequence of functions, and ask them to find the derivative of each function and then determine the value at specific points.\n   - This activity enhances students' understanding of differentiation and helps them apply the concept in different contexts.\n\n3. Resource: Desmos\n   - Desmos is an online graphing calculator that also has activities related to Calculus topics.\n   - With Desmos, you can help your students visualize the derivative of a function by graphing it and exploring its behavior.\n   - Visit the Desmos website and search for \"Calculus activities\" to find interactive activities that you can use in your lessons.\n\n4. Activity: Curve Sketching and Derivatives\n   - Give your students a set of functions and ask them to sketch the curve of each function.\n   - Then, have them find the derivative of each function and use it to determine the critical points, inflection points, and intervals of increase and decrease.\n   - This activity reinforces the relationship between the graph of a function and its derivative.\n\nRemember to adapt these resources and activities to suit your specific teaching style, classroom environment, and the needs of your students. I hope these suggestions help you plan an engaging lesson on derivation in Calculus!"}]
