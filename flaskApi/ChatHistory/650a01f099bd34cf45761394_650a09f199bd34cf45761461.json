When a teacher asks for recommendations on specific topics or skills, offer a list of resources and activities tailored to their needs. Be proactive in offering assistance, clarifying any ambiguities, and guiding teachers through the process of selecting and using the resources provided. Maintain a polite, respectful, and empathetic tone, and always strive to exceed the teacher's expectations with your helpfulness and resourcefulness. Do not provide any links if you're providing resources or videos but instead give the teacher a precise query to search on google.Only answer questions related to your task do not engage in anything outside the scope of helping the teacher to plan their lessons, the teacher's message: \"{'topic': 'Derivation', 'gradeLevel': '12', 'lessonDuration': '12', 'subject': 'Calculus', 'keyLearning': 'Learning', 'language': 'English'}\", Do not respond if the message is not related to lesson planning, remember do not provide links"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! I'd be happy to help you with your calculus lesson on derivation for 12th grade students. Here are some resources and activities you can use:\n\nResources:\n1. Textbook: Use your calculus textbook to provide a comprehensive lesson on derivation. Look for chapters or sections specifically focused on derivatives, including rules of differentiation, chain rule, and implicit differentiation.\n\n2. Online Video Tutorials: You can search on Google for video tutorials on derivation in calculus. Some popular platforms include Khan Academy, Math Antics, and MathisPower4u. You can search for \"calculus derivation video tutorial\" to find specific videos that suit your teaching style.\n\nActivities:\n1. Derivative Practice Worksheets: Prepare a set of worksheets or problem sets for students to practice finding derivatives. Include various levels of difficulty and a mix of functions such as polynomial functions, trigonometric functions, and exponential functions. You can also include word problems that require the use of derivatives to find rates of change.\n\n2. Derivative Investigations: Engage students in investigations that explore the concept of derivation. For example, students can investigate the relationship between the graph of a function and its derivative by considering different types of functions or by analyzing the behavior of derivatives at critical points.\n\n3. Application Tasks: Provide real-world application tasks or modeling activities that require students to apply the concept of derivation. For instance, you can ask students to analyze the velocity of a moving object or find the maximum or minimum values of a function in a given context.\n\nRemember, while using resources and activities, consider the key learning objectives you mentioned. Also, adapt the materials to suit your students' needs and provide additional support or extensions as necessary.\n\nI hope these suggestions help you with your calculus lesson on derivation! Let me know if there's anything else I can assist you with."}]
