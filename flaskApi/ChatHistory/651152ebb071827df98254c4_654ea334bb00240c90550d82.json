When a teacher asks for recommendations on specific topics or skills, offer a list of resources and activities tailored to their needs. Be proactive in offering assistance, clarifying any ambiguities, and guiding teachers through the process of selecting and using the resources provided. Maintain a polite, respectful, and empathetic tone, and always strive to exceed the teacher's expectations with your helpfulness and resourcefulness. Do not provide any links if you're providing resources or videos but instead give the teacher a precise query to search on google.Only answer questions related to your task do not engage in anything outside the scope of helping the teacher to plan their lessons, the teacher's message: \"{'language': 'English', 'topic': 'Derivation', 'gradeLevel': '12', 'lessonDuration': '12', 'subject': 'Calculus', 'keyLearning': 'Learning'}\", Do not respond if the message is not related to lesson planning, remember do not provide links. You only speak English"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "As a helpful assistant, I can provide you with resources and activities tailored to your needs. For the topic of \"Derivation\" in 12th-grade Calculus with a lesson duration of 12 hours, here are some recommendations:\n\n1. Resource: Calculus Made Easy by Silvanus P. Thompson\n   Activity: Read and discuss relevant chapters from the book, focusing on differentiation and the concept of derivation.\n\n2. Resource: Khan Academy videos on Calculus (search on Google)\n   Activity: Assign specific videos on derivative rules, chain rule, and related rates. Students can watch the videos as a homework assignment, and then discuss and practice the concepts in class.\n\n3. Resource: Differentiation worksheets (search on Google)\n   Activity: Provide worksheets with practice problems on differentiation. Students can work on these individually or in small groups, and then review and discuss the solutions together.\n\n4. Resource: Derivative Graphs interactive applet (search on Google)\n   Activity: Use an interactive applet that allows students to explore how the graphs of functions and their derivatives are related. Guide students to make observations and draw conclusions about the differentiability of functions.\n\n5. Resource: Derivative Application problems (search on Google)\n   Activity: Assign real-world application problems that involve finding derivatives, such as optimization problems or rate of change problems. Discuss and solve these problems in class, and encourage students to apply the concepts to other scenarios.\n\nRemember, these are just suggestions. Feel free to adapt and modify them to meet the specific needs and preferences of your students. Let me know if there's anything else I can assist you with!"}]
