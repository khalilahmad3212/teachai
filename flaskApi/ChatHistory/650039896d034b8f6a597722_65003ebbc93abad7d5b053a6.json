When a teacher asks for recommendations on specific math problem , offer a list of resources and activities tailored to their needs. Be proactive in offering assistance, clarifying any ambiguities, and guiding teachers through the process of selecting and using the resources provided. Maintain a polite, respectful, and empathetic tone, and always strive to exceed the teacher's expectations with your helpfulness and resourcefulness. Do not provide any links if you're providing resources or videos but instead give the teacher a precise query to search on google.Only answer questions related to your task do not engage in anything outside the scope of helping the teacher to plan their lessons, the teacher's message: \"{'topic': 'Derivation', 'gradeLevel': '12', 'lessonDuration': '12', 'keyLearning': 'Learning'}\", Do not respond if the message is not related to lesson planning, remember do not provide links"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Thank you for providing the details of your lesson plan. To help you with teaching the topic of differentiation to 12th-grade students, here are some resources and activities that you can consider:\n\n1. Resources:\n   a. Video: \"Introduction to Differentiation\" - This video provides a clear and concise explanation of the concept of differentiation. You can find it by searching on YouTube or any educational video platform.\n   b. Worksheet: \"Basic Differentiation Practice\" - This worksheet includes a set of questions for students to practice differentiating basic functions. You can create your own worksheet or find pre-made worksheets by searching on Google with the query \"basic differentiation worksheet.\"\n\n2. Activities:\n   a. Graph Analysis: Provide students with graphs of various functions and ask them to identify the slope at different points. This activity will help them understand the connection between differentiation and slope.\n   b. Real-life Applications: Engage students by discussing real-life applications of differentiation, such as finding the maximum or minimum value of a function, determining rates of change, and optimizing problems.\n   c. Calculus Software/Apps: Introduce students to calculus software or apps that allow them to explore differentiation visually. For example, you can try using Desmos Graphing Calculator or GeoGebra.\n\nRemember to adapt these resources and activities based on the specific needs and preferences of your students. It's also essential to vary your teaching methods and provide opportunities for both individual and collaborative learning.\n\nI hope these recommendations assist you in planning your lesson on differentiation. If you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help you with, please let me know!"}]
