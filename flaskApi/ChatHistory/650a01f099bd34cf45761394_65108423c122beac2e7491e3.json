She explains that spoken English used in everyday life is often different from textbook or school English. She offers tips to help overcome this challenge and suggests downloading a free PDF with a detailed explanation of the points discussed, a quiz, and key vocabulary. Lucy also mentions that by signing up to her mailing list, viewers will receive weekly lesson PDFs and other updates. This video discusses the differences between spoken English and textbook English. The speaker gives examples of how grammar rules, such as using the passive voice, ending sentences with prepositions, and using contractions, may differ when speaking compared to what is taught in formal English classes. The video also mentions that native speakers may bend certain rules when speaking, such as using different verb forms. Overall, the video highlights the variations between spoken English and what is taught in textbooks or formal education. In this video, the speaker discusses three tips for mastering English. The first tip is about the use of contractions in expressions like \"can't believe it.\" In conversation, it's common to drop the subject and use contractions like \"can't\" instead of \"cannot.\" The second tip suggests getting feedback from trained professionals to improve English skills. The speaker recommends Language Talk, an online language tutor platform with high-quality teachers. The speaker offers a $10 lesson credit for signing up and taking the first lesson. The third tip is about connected speech, which is when native English speakers squish words together to convey information quickly and efficiently. The speaker encourages listeners to practice listening to British content or engage in conversations with native speakers to understand connected speech better. The video discusses several aspects of connected speech in British English. It mentions that one aspect is \"elision,\" which is the omission of certain sounds in speech to make pronunciation more efficient and fluid. An example given is dropping the final sound in words like \"not\" and \"but.\" Another aspect is \"assimilation,\" which occurs when a sound changes to become more like a neighboring sound. This often happens with the T and D sounds when followed by a \"yeah\" sound. The video also explains the \"intrusive R,\" which is when an R sound is sometimes inserted between two vowel sounds to make the transition smoother. It mentions the \"linking R,\" which occurs when a word ending in the letter R is followed by a word beginning with a vowel sound. Lastly, the video mentions the concept of \"weak form,\" where certain words are often pronounced with a reduced or weak form, especially with function words such as prepositions, articles, and auxiliary verbs. This video provides an overview of two important aspects of spoken English: connected speech and contractions. Connected speech refers to the blending of words together to form natural speech patterns. Contractions, on the other hand, involve shortening words by combining two or more words and replacing letters with an apostrophe. Native speakers of English frequently use contractions in spoken language. The video also mentions informal contractions, which are more commonly used in casual conversations. Understanding contractions and connected speech can greatly improve your comprehension skills. Additionally, it is recommended to learn idioms and slang to better understand native speakers. The video discusses the use of slang and idioms in English, and how they add color and character to language. The video lists some common slang terms, such as \"grub\" for food, \"lurgy\" for feeling unwell, and \"fit\" to mean attractive. It also mentions idioms like \"dab hand\" for being skilled at something, being \"knackered\" to mean extremely tired, and feeling \"chuffed\" for being very happy or pleased. The video includes a downloadable PDF with more idioms and slang phrases, and offers to make a dedicated video about slang and idioms if viewers are interested. In this video, the speaker gives tips to help viewers with their English. They mention a PDF document designed to assist with learning, as well as an offer on a platform called Langotalk. The speaker suggests using a discount code and contacting the support team after enrolling in the first lesson. Additionally, they mention the recent launch of B1, B2, and C1 programs for those wanting to improve their English proficiency. The video ends with a farewell and music.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In this video, English teacher Lucy discusses the challenges of understanding spoken English and offers tips to overcome this difficulty.
