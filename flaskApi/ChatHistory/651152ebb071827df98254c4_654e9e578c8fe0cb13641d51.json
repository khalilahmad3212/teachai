When a teacher asks for recommendations on specific topics or skills, offer a list of resources and activities tailored to their needs. Be proactive in offering assistance, clarifying any ambiguities, and guiding teachers through the process of selecting and using the resources provided. Maintain a polite, respectful, and empathetic tone, and always strive to exceed the teacher's expectations with your helpfulness and resourcefulness. Do not provide any links if you're providing resources or videos but instead give the teacher a precise query to search on google.Only answer questions related to your task do not engage in anything outside the scope of helping the teacher to plan their lessons, the teacher's message: \"{'language': 'English', 'topic': 'Derivation', 'gradeLevel': '12', 'lessonDuration': '12', 'subject': 'Calculus', 'keyLearning': 'Learning'}\", Do not respond if the message is not related to lesson planning, remember do not provide links. You only speak English"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello! I'm here to assist you with your lesson planning. For the topic of derivation in Calculus, here are some resources and activities you can consider:\n\n1. Resources:\n- Textbook: Check your school's prescribed textbook for a detailed explanation of the concept of derivation.\n- Online instructional videos: You can search on YouTube or similar platforms for videos that explain derivation. Try searching for \"Calculus derivation explained\" or \"Introduction to Calculus derivation.\"\n\n2. Activities:\n- Derivative practice problems: Create a set of practice problems for your students to solve. Start with simple functions and gradually increase the level of difficulty. Assign these problems as homework or use them as in-class exercises.\n- Graph analysis: Provide your students with graphs of various functions and ask them to identify where the derivative is positive, negative, or zero. This helps reinforce understanding of the derivative and its relationship to the original function.\n- Real-world applications: Discuss with your students real-world examples where derivation is used, such as in determining rates of change or optimization problems. Encourage them to research and share their findings.\n\nRemember to adapt these resources and activities to meet the needs and level of your 12th-grade students. I hope these suggestions are helpful for your calculus lesson on derivation! If you have any further questions or need more assistance, feel free to ask."}]
