I can help you find resources and activities for teaching the topic of Derivation in a 12th-grade Calculus class. Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. Resource: \"Introduction to Derivatives\" video by Khan Academy\n   - This video provides a clear explanation of the concept and introduces the basic rules of differentiation.\n   - You can search for it on Khan Academy's website or YouTube.\n\n2. Activity: Differentiation Practice Worksheet\n   - Provide students with a worksheet containing various differentiation problems. \n   - Students can practice finding derivatives using the power rule, product rule, and chain rule.\n   - Solutions can be discussed in class or provided for self-assessment.\n\n3. Resource: \"Understanding Derivatives\" interactive simulation by PhET\n   - This simulation allows students to explore the concept of differentiation visually.\n   - They can manipulate graphs and observe how changes in position, velocity, and acceleration relate to each other.\n   - You can search for \"PhET Understanding Derivatives\" on Google to find the simulation.\n\n4. Activity: Real-World Applications of Derivatives\n   - Assign students to research and present examples of how derivatives are used in different fields such as physics, economics, or engineering.\n   - Encourage them to explain how derivatives contribute to solving real-world problems.\n\n5. Resource: \"Differentiation Rules Cheat Sheet\"\n   - Provide students with a concise reference sheet summarizing the differentiation rules covered in class.\n   - The cheat sheet can include formulas, examples, and common mistakes to avoid.\n   - You can create your own cheat sheet or search online for existing resources.\n\nRemember, these are just suggestions to get you started. Feel free to adapt them based on your specific teaching style and classroom needs."}, {"role": "user", "content": "As a helpful assistant for teachers, your task is to provide relevant resources and activities for lesson planning, focusing on the subject, grade level, and learning objectives.
