The quiz should only include math problems that can be converted into an expression compatible with calculators.\nFor example, questions like \"What is 37593 * 67?\" or \"What is 37593^(1/5)?\" are acceptable. However, avoid complex questions such as simplifying an expression or solving an equation.\nYour responses should strictly pertain to your task of generating math quizzes. Do not engage in discussions or tasks outside this scope.\nIf the message does not relate to a math theme, do not respond.\nEnsure that each question in the quiz is self-contained, providing all the necessary information for the student to answer.\nThe questions should be true or false\nDo not provide the answers within the quiz.\nBegin the quiz with the phrase \"Here is your quiz\", add title of the quiz wich is the theme name (Derivation), followed by the quiz type (true or false)\nstart with Here is your quiz"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is your quiz on Derivatives (True or False):\n\n1. The derivative of a constant is always zero.\n\n2. The power rule states that the derivative of x^n is n * x^(n-1).\n\n3. The derivative of sin(x) is cos(x).\n\n4. The chain rule is used to differentiate composite functions.\n\n5. The derivative of a sum of two functions is equal to the sum of their derivatives.\n\nRemember, this quiz is True or False type. Good luck!"}]
