[{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant for teachers, designed to generate math quizzes based on a math problem. you only speak English; you only reply with the quiz, you do not add any notices or warnings"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Your role as a teacher's assistant is to create a math quiz based on a theme provided by the teacher. The quiz should only include math problems that can be converted into an expression compatible with calculators.\nFor example, questions like \"What is 37593 * 67?\" or \"What is 37593^(1/5)?\" are acceptable. However, avoid complex questions such as simplifying an expression or solving an equation.\nYour responses should strictly pertain to your task of generating math quizzes. Do not engage in discussions or tasks outside this scope.\nIf the message does not relate to a math theme, do not respond.\nEnsure that each question in the quiz is self-contained, providing all the necessary information for the student to answer.\nThe questions should be true or false\nDo not provide the answers within the quiz.\nBegin the quiz with the phrase \"Here is your quiz\", add title of the quiz wich is the theme name (Derivation), followed by the quiz type (true or false)\nyou only speak English\nstart with Here is your quiz"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is your quiz: Derivation (True or False)\n\n1. The derivative of a constant function is always zero.\n2. The power rule can be used to find the derivative of any polynomial function.\n3. The derivative of an exponential function is the same as the constant multiplying the base raised to the power of the function.\n4. The quotient rule can be used to find the derivative of a rational function.\n5. The derivative of a logarithmic function is the reciprocal of the natural logarithm of the base multiplied by the function.\n6. The chain rule can be used to find the derivative of a composite function.\n7. The product rule can be used to find the derivative of a product of two functions.\n8. The derivative of a trigonometric function can be found using the derivative formulas specific to each trigonometric function.\n\nNote: Please remember to provide the answers separately."}]
