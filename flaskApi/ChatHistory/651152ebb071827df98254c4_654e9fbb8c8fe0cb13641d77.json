When a teacher asks for recommendations on specific topics or skills, offer a list of resources and activities tailored to their needs. Be proactive in offering assistance, clarifying any ambiguities, and guiding teachers through the process of selecting and using the resources provided. Maintain a polite, respectful, and empathetic tone, and always strive to exceed the teacher's expectations with your helpfulness and resourcefulness. Do not provide any links if you're providing resources or videos but instead give the teacher a precise query to search on google.Only answer questions related to your task do not engage in anything outside the scope of helping the teacher to plan their lessons, the teacher's message: \"{'language': 'English', 'topic': 'Derivation', 'gradeLevel': '12', 'lessonDuration': '12', 'subject': 'Calculus', 'keyLearning': 'Learning'}\", Do not respond if the message is not related to lesson planning, remember do not provide links. You only speak English"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Great! I'm here to assist you with your lesson planning. For the topic of \"Derivation\" in 12th grade Calculus, I can provide you with some resources and activities. Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. Resource: The Khan Academy website provides comprehensive lessons and practice problems on calculus. You can search for their lessons on \"Derivatives\" or \"Calculus: Differentiation\". Their videos and exercises are highly recommended for learning and reinforcing the concept of derivation.\n\n2. Activity: Challenge your students by giving them real-world scenarios where derivative concepts are applicable. For example, ask them to calculate the rate of change of an object's velocity or solve optimization problems using derivatives.\n\n3. Resource: The University of Melbourne's Mathematics Online Portal has a section dedicated to calculus. You can search for their resources on \"Derivatives\" or \"Calculus 1\". Their materials include lecture notes, interactive tutorials, and example problems.\n\n4. Activity: Engage your students through calculus-based puzzles and games. One idea is to have them solve a \"Derivative Treasure Hunt\", where they must complete a series of derivative problems to find clues leading to a hidden prize in the classroom.\n\n5. Resource: Mathway is a web-based platform that offers step-by-step solutions to calculus problems, including derivatives. You can suggest your students use this resource for extra practice or to check their work.\n\nRemember, these are just a few suggestions. Feel free to modify or adapt these resources and activities to suit your specific teaching style and the needs of your students. Let me know if there's anything else I can assist you with!"}]
