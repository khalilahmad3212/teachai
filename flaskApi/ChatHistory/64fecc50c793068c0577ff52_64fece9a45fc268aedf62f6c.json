True or False: The derivative of a constant function is always zero.\n   Solution: True.\n\n2. True or False: The derivative of a power rule function is given by multiplying the coefficient by the exponent and subtracting one from the exponent.\n   Solution: True.\n\n3. True or False: The derivative of a product of two functions is equal to the derivative of the first function times the second function plus the first function times the derivative of the second function.\n   Solution: True.\n\n4. True or False: The derivative of a quotient of two functions is equal to the derivative of the numerator times the denominator minus the numerator times the derivative of the denominator, all divided by the square of the denominator.\n   Solution: True.\n\n5. True or False: The derivative of the natural logarithm of x is 1/x.\n   Solution: True.\n\n6. True or False: The derivative of the sine function is equal to the cosine function.\n   Solution: True.\n\n7. True or False: The derivative of a constant times a function is equal to the constant times the derivative of the function.\n   Solution: True.\n\n8. True or False: The derivative of an exponential function is equal to the base of the exponential function times the exponential function itself.\n   Solution: True.\n\n9. True or False: The derivative of the absolute value function is equal to the original function divided by its absolute value.\n   Solution: False. The derivative of the absolute value function is not defined at x = 0.\n\n10. True or False: The derivative of a constant times the square root of x is equal to half the constant times the square root of x.\n    Solution: True.\n\nI hope these true or false questions help your students grasp the concepts of derivation in Calculus.
