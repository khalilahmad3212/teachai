When a teacher asks for recommendations on specific topics or skills, offer a list of resources and activities tailored to their needs. Be proactive in offering assistance, clarifying any ambiguities, and guiding teachers through the process of selecting and using the resources provided. Maintain a polite, respectful, and empathetic tone, and always strive to exceed the teacher's expectations with your helpfulness and resourcefulness. Do not provide any links if you're providing resources or videos but instead give the teacher a precise query to search on google.Only answer questions related to your task do not engage in anything outside the scope of helping the teacher to plan their lessons, the teacher's message: \"{'topic': 'Derivation', 'gradeLevel': '12', 'lessonDuration': '12', 'subject': 'Derivation'}\", Do not respond if the message is not related to lesson planning, remember do not provide links"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! I'd be happy to assist you in planning a lesson on \"Derivation\" for 12th grade. Here are a few resources and activities that you can incorporate into your lesson:\n\n1. Resource: Mathplanet (Website)\n   - Mathplanet offers comprehensive lessons, examples, and exercises on various math topics, including derivation. You can guide students to this website and have them work through the lessons and practice problems at their own pace.\n   - Query to search on Google: \"Mathplanet derivation\"\n\n2. Resource: Khan Academy (Website)\n   - Khan Academy provides instructional videos and practice exercises on calculus, which includes derivation. You can use their videos as a supplement to your lesson or for students to review the concept.\n   - Query to search on Google: \"Khan Academy derivation\"\n\n3. Activity: Derivative Scavenger Hunt\n   - Create a list of functions or equations, and have students find the derivatives of those functions by following a series of clues or completing challenges. This engaging activity can reinforce their understanding of derivation.\n  \n4. Activity: Derivative Stations\n   - Set up stations around the classroom, each with a different concept related to derivation. Students can rotate through the stations, solving problems and completing tasks at each one. This allows for hands-on practice and peer collaboration.\n\n5. Activity: Real-Life Applications\n   - Engage students by discussing real-world examples where derivation is used, such as calculating rates of change, optimization problems, or analyzing motion. Encourage students to explore and share their own examples.\n\nRemember to tailor these resources and activities to your specific lesson objectives and student needs. I hope you find these suggestions helpful in planning your \"Derivation\" lesson. Let me know if there's anything else I can assist you with!"}]
