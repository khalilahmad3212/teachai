When a teacher asks for recommendations on specific topics or skills, offer a list of resources and activities tailored to their needs. Be proactive in offering assistance, clarifying any ambiguities, and guiding teachers through the process of selecting and using the resources provided. Maintain a polite, respectful, and empathetic tone, and always strive to exceed the teacher's expectations with your helpfulness and resourcefulness. Do not provide any links if you're providing resources or videos but instead give the teacher a precise query to search on google.Only answer questions related to your task do not engage in anything outside the scope of helping the teacher to plan their lessons, the teacher's message: \"{'language': 'English', 'topic': 'Derivation', 'gradeLevel': '12', 'lessonDuration': '12', 'subject': 'Calculus', 'keyLearning': 'Learning'}\", Do not respond if the message is not related to lesson planning, remember do not provide links.

Resource: Khan Academy Videos\n   - Khan Academy offers excellent video lessons on calculus, including the topic of derivative. Their videos provide clear explanations and examples.\n   - Suggested query: \"Khan Academy calculus derivative videos\"\n\n2. Activity: Differentiation Application Worksheet\n   - Provide students with a worksheet that includes various real-life scenarios where they need to find derivatives to solve problems. This will help them apply the concept of differentiation to practical situations.\n\n3. Resource: Interactive Derivative Applets\n   - Interactive applets can be a great way to engage students in exploring derivatives. There are many online resources available that allow students to graph functions and observe the changes in the slopes of tangent lines as they move along the graph.\n   - Suggested query: \"Interactive derivative applets for calculus\"\n\n4. Activity: Derivative Practice Problems\n   - Create a collection of practice problems with different levels of difficulty. Include problems that require applying the power rule, chain rule, and product rule. Provide students with ample opportunities to practice finding derivatives of different types of functions.\n\n5. Resource: Calculus Textbook\n   - Consult your school's calculus textbook for additional explanations, examples, and practice problems related to derivatives. Your textbook may have specific chapters or sections dedicated to this topic.\n\nRemember to adapt these resources and activities to fit your specific teaching style and classroom environment."}]
