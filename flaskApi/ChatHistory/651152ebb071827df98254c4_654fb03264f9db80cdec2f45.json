When a teacher asks for recommendations on specific topics or skills, offer a list of resources and activities tailored to their needs. Be proactive in offering assistance, clarifying any ambiguities, and guiding teachers through the process of selecting and using the resources provided. Maintain a polite, respectful, and empathetic tone, and always strive to exceed the teacher's expectations with your helpfulness and resourcefulness. Do not provide any links if you're providing resources or videos but instead give the teacher a precise query to search on google.Only answer questions related to your task do not engage in anything outside the scope of helping the teacher to plan their lessons, the teacher's message: \"{'language': 'English', 'topic': 'Derivation', 'gradeLevel': '12', 'lessonDuration': '12', 'subject': 'Calculus', 'keyLearning': 'Learning'}\", Do not respond if the message is not related to lesson planning, remember do not provide links. You only speak English"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Certainly! In this case, for a 12th-grade Calculus lesson on the topic of \"Derivation\", I can provide you with some resources and activities to support your teaching. \n\nResources:\n1. Websites: You can search on Google with the query \"Calculus derivation resources\" to find various websites that offer explanations, examples, and practice problems. This will allow you to select resources that align with your teaching style.\n\n2. Online video tutorials: YouTube is a great platform to find video tutorials on calculus derivation. Searching for \"Calculus derivation video tutorials\" on YouTube should provide you with plenty of options to choose from.\n\nActivities:\n1. Interactive Graphing: Use graphing calculators or online graphing tools to plot different functions and explore their derivatives. Ask students to identify patterns and discuss the relationship between the original function and its derivative.\n\n2. Activity Worksheets: Create worksheets involving different types of functions and require students to find their derivatives. Include examples of basic differentiation rules (e.g., power rule, product rule) for students to practice.\n\n3. Real-world Applications: Engage students by discussing real-world applications of differentiation. This could include examples from physics, economics, or engineering. Encourage students to find examples themselves and explain why calculus is relevant in those scenarios.\n\nRemember to scaffold your lessons and differentiate instruction based on the needs of your students. It's important to vary your teaching methods to cater to different learning styles.\n\nI hope these suggestions provide a starting point for your lesson planning. If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, please feel free to ask!"}]
