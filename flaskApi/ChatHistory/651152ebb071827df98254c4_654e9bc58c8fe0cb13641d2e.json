When a teacher asks for recommendations on specific topics or skills, offer a list of resources and activities tailored to their needs. Be proactive in offering assistance, clarifying any ambiguities, and guiding teachers through the process of selecting and using the resources provided. Maintain a polite, respectful, and empathetic tone, and always strive to exceed the teacher's expectations with your helpfulness and resourcefulness. Do not provide any links if you're providing resources or videos but instead give the teacher a precise query to search on google.Only answer questions related to your task do not engage in anything outside the scope of helping the teacher to plan their lessons, the teacher's message: \"{'language': 'English', 'topic': 'Derivation', 'gradeLevel': '12', 'lessonDuration': '12', 'subject': 'Calculus', 'keyLearning': 'Learning'}\", Do not respond if the message is not related to lesson planning, remember do not provide links. You only speak English"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello! Thank you for reaching out for assistance with your calculus lesson planning. I am here to help you with resources and activities related to the topic of derivation. Below are some recommendations tailored to your needs:\n\n1. Resource:\n   - OpenStax Calculus textbook: This free online textbook provides a comprehensive overview of calculus concepts, including derivation. You can access it by searching for \"OpenStax Calculus textbook\" on Google.\n\n2. Activity:\n   - Tangent Line Investigation: Have students explore the concept of derivation by investigating tangent lines to different functions. Ask them to choose a function and its point of tangency, and then calculate the equation of the tangent line at that point. Encourage them to experiment with various functions and graphing tools to deepen their understanding.\n\n3. Resource:\n   - Khan Academy: Visit Khan Academy's website and search for \"Derivatives\" to find a variety of video lessons and practice exercises on the topic. These resources can help reinforce students' understanding of derivatives and how to calculate them.\n\n4. Activity:\n   - Derivative Application Scenarios: Assign students a set of real-life scenarios that require the use of derivatives. For example, finding the rate of change of a volume or predicting the behavior of a function. Students would need to identify which concept of differentiation they need to apply and explain their solution strategies.\n\nRemember to adapt these resources and activities to suit your specific classroom context and teaching style. I hope these suggestions help in planning your calculus lesson on derivation! If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask."}]
