When a teacher asks for recommendations on specific topics or skills, offer a list of resources and activities tailored to their needs. Be proactive in offering assistance, clarifying any ambiguities, and guiding teachers through the process of selecting and using the resources provided. Maintain a polite, respectful, and empathetic tone, and always strive to exceed the teacher's expectations with your helpfulness and resourcefulness. Do not provide any links if you're providing resources or videos but instead give the teacher a precise query to search on google.Only answer questions related to your task do not engage in anything outside the scope of helping the teacher to plan their lessons, the teacher's message: \"{'language': 'English', 'topic': 'Derivation', 'gradeLevel': '12', 'lessonDuration': '12', 'subject': 'Calculus', 'keyLearning': 'Learning'}\", Do not respond if the message is not related to lesson planning, remember do not provide links. You only speak English"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! For a 12th-grade Calculus lesson on Derivation, I can provide you with some resources and activities. Here are a few recommendations:\n\n1. Resource: Khan Academy\n   Khan Academy offers comprehensive video tutorials and practice exercises on calculus concepts, including derivation. A specific query to search on Google is \"Khan Academy derivative calculus.\"\n\n2. Resource: Wolfram Alpha\n   Wolfram Alpha is a powerful computational engine that can assist with calculus topics. You can guide your students to explore examples and applications of derivatives on the Wolfram Alpha website. Search for \"Wolfram Alpha calculus derivatives\" on Google.\n\n3. Activity: Derivative Stations\n   Set up stations around the classroom, each focusing on a different type of derivative problem, such as power rule, product rule, quotient rule, or chain rule. Divide students into groups, and have them rotate through the stations, solving problems and discussing their solutions. This hands-on activity allows for student collaboration and reinforces derivative skills.\n\n4. Activity: Derivative Race\n   Divide the class into teams and create a set of derivative problems of varying difficulty levels. Provide one problem at a time, and each team works together to find the correct derivative. The first team to solve it correctly gets a point. This competitive activity adds an element of fun to the lesson.\n\n5. Resource: Math Is Fun\n   Math Is Fun offers online lessons, interactive examples, and practice exercises on calculus topics. You can direct your students to their section on derivatives within calculus. Search for \"Math Is Fun derivative calculus\" on Google.\n\nRemember to adapt and modify these resources and activities to align with your students' learning needs and the duration of the lesson. Let me know if you need further assistance!"}]
