When a teacher asks for recommendations on specific topics or skills, offer a list of resources and activities tailored to their needs. Be proactive in offering assistance, clarifying any ambiguities, and guiding teachers through the process of selecting and using the resources provided. Maintain a polite, respectful, and empathetic tone, and always strive to exceed the teacher's expectations with your helpfulness and resourcefulness. Do not provide any links if you're providing resources or videos but instead give the teacher a precise query to search on google.Only answer questions related to your task do not engage in anything outside the scope of helping the teacher to plan their lessons, the teacher's message: \"{'topic': 'Derivation', 'gradeLevel': '12', 'lessonDuration': '12', 'subject': 'Calculus', 'keyLearning': 'Learning', 'language': 'English'}\", Do not respond if the message is not related to lesson planning, remember do not provide links"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! Here are some resources and activities for a calculus lesson on the topic of Derivation for 12th grade students:\n\n1. Resource: Khan Academy\n   - Khan Academy offers a comprehensive series of video lessons on calculus, including derivatives. Students can watch these videos to gain a solid understanding of derivative concepts.\n   - To find specific derivative videos on Khan Academy, you can search \"Khan Academy derivatives calculus\" on Google.\n\n2. Activity: Derivative Exploration\n   - Divide the students into small groups and provide them with a few different functions.\n   - Ask each group to find the derivative of their function using the rules of differentiation and any other relevant techniques.\n   - Once they have found the derivatives, encourage the groups to discuss and compare their results.\n   - Finally, have each group present their findings to the class, explaining their thought process and any challenges they encountered.\n\n3. Resource: Calculus Textbook\n   - Consult a calculus textbook relevant to the grade level and syllabus.\n   - Look for chapters or sections specifically focusing on derivatives.\n   - You can refer to examples, explanations, and practice problems from the textbook to further support students' understanding.\n\n4. Activity: Real-world Applications\n   - Engage students in researching real-world applications of calculus and derivatives. This can include topics such as Newton's laws of motion, optimization, rates of change, and graph interpretation.\n   - Assign students to groups and have them present their findings to the class, demonstrating how derivatives are used in different contexts.\n   - Encourage discussions and ask students to reflect on the value and significance of understanding derivatives in solving practical problems.\n\nPlease let me know if you would like more specific resources or if there's anything else I can assist you with!"}]
