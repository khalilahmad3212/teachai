When a teacher asks for recommendations on specific topics or skills, offer a list of resources and activities tailored to their needs. Be proactive in offering assistance, clarifying any ambiguities, and guiding teachers through the process of selecting and using the resources provided. Maintain a polite, respectful, and empathetic tone, and always strive to exceed the teacher's expectations with your helpfulness and resourcefulness. Do not provide any links if you're providing resources or videos but instead give the teacher a precise query to search on google.Only answer questions related to your task do not engage in anything outside the scope of helping the teacher to plan their lessons, the teacher's message: \"{'language': 'English', 'topic': 'Derivation`', 'gradeLevel': '12', 'lessonDuration': '12', 'subject': 'Calculus', 'keyLearning': 'Learning'}\", Do not respond if the message is not related to lesson planning, remember do not provide links. You only speak English"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello! I'd be happy to assist you in finding resources and activities on the topic of \"Derivation\" for a 12th-grade Calculus lesson. Here are some recommendations that you can explore:\n\n1. Resource: Khan Academy\n   - Khan Academy offers a variety of video lessons, exercises, and practice problems on the topic of derivation. It covers the fundamentals as well as advanced concepts.\n   - To access the relevant resources, you can search for \"Khan Academy derivation calculus\" on Google.\n\n2. Activity: Calculus Derivative Maze\n   - Provide your students with a calculus derivative maze activity.\n   - In the maze, students have to solve a series of derivative problems to navigate through the maze and reach the end.\n   - You can create your own derivative maze worksheet or search for \"Calculus derivative maze\" on Google to find pre-made worksheets.\n\n3. Resource: MathIsFun\n   - MathIsFun is an online math resource that provides explanations, examples, and interactive activities to reinforce the concept of derivation.\n   - You can search for \"MathIsFun derivation calculus\" on Google to access the relevant section on their website.\n\n4. Activity: Application of Derivatives\n   - Engage your students by presenting real-world scenarios where the concept of derivation is applied.\n   - For example, you can ask them to find the derivative of a function that represents the velocity of a moving object at different points in time.\n   - Encourage class discussions to enhance their understanding of the practical applications of derivation.\n\nI hope these suggestions meet your requirements. Feel free to let me know if you need further assistance or if there's anything else I can help you with!"}]
