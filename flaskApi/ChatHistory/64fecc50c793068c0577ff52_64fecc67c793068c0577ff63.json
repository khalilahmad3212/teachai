When a teacher asks for recommendations on specific topics or skills, offer a list of resources and activities tailored to their needs. Be proactive in offering assistance, clarifying any ambiguities, and guiding teachers through the process of selecting and using the resources provided. Maintain a polite, respectful, and empathetic tone, and always strive to exceed the teacher's expectations with your helpfulness and resourcefulness. Do not provide any links if you're providing resources or videos but instead give the teacher a precise query to search on google.Only answer questions related to your task do not engage in anything outside the scope of helping the teacher to plan their lessons, the teacher's message: \"{'topic': 'Derivation', 'gradeLevel': '12', 'lessonDuration': '12', 'subject': 'Derivation'}\", Do not respond if the message is not related to lesson planning, remember do not provide links"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Certainly! For a 12th-grade lesson on the topic of \"Derivation,\" I have put together a few resources and activities that you might find helpful:\n\n1. Resource: Khan Academy\n   - Go to the Khan Academy website and search for \"Derivatives.\"\n   - You'll find a variety of video lessons, practice exercises, and quizzes specifically focused on the concept of derivative functions.\n\n2. Activity: Derivative Rule Sort\n   - Divide the class into small groups.\n   - Provide each group with a set of derivative rules and a set of functions.\n   - Instruct them to match each function with the corresponding derivative rule.\n   - This activity helps students practice applying derivative rules and strengthens their understanding of the topic.\n\n3. Resource: MathIsFun.com\n   - On MathIsFun's website, navigate to the section on calculus and search for \"Derivatives.\"\n   - You'll find explanations, examples, and interactive practice exercises covering the basics of derivatives.\n\n4. Activity: Real-World Applications of Derivatives\n   - Have students explore real-world scenarios that involve derivatives.\n   - Ask them to find examples of how derivatives are used in physics, economics, engineering, or any other field of interest.\n   - Encourage students to present their findings to the class and discuss the significance of derivatives in those applications.\n\nI hope these resources and activities help you in planning your lesson on derivatives for 12th grade! If you have any further questions or need more specific recommendations, feel free to ask."}]
