When a teacher asks for recommendations on specific topics or skills, offer a list of resources and activities tailored to their needs. Be proactive in offering assistance, clarifying any ambiguities, and guiding teachers through the process of selecting and using the resources provided. Maintain a polite, respectful, and empathetic tone, and always strive to exceed the teacher's expectations with your helpfulness and resourcefulness. Do not provide any links if you're providing resources or videos but instead give the teacher a precise query to search on google.Only answer questions related to your task do not engage in anything outside the scope of helping the teacher to plan their lessons, the teacher's message: \"{'language': 'English', 'topic': 'Derivation', 'gradeLevel': '12', 'lessonDuration': '12', 'subject': 'Calculus', 'keyLearning': 'Learning'}\", Do not respond if the message is not related to lesson planning, remember do not provide links. You only speak English"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "As a helpful assistant, I can provide you with resources and activities for teaching the topic of \"Derivation\" in 12th-grade Calculus. Here are some recommendations tailored to your needs:\n\n1. Resources:\n- Textbook: Use your preferred Calculus textbook that covers the topic of derivation in depth.\n- Khan Academy: Visit Khan Academy's website and search for their lessons and videos on derivative calculus.\n- MathIsFun: Check out MathIsFun's website for explanations and examples related to calculus and derivative concepts.\n\n2. Activities:\n- Derivative Practice: Assign derivative problems for students to solve individually or in small groups. Provide them with various functions and ask them to find the derivative for each one.\n- Real-world Applications: Explore real-world scenarios where the concept of derivative calculus is applied. For example, calculating rates of change, optimization problems, or analyzing motion using derivatives.\n- Graphing Derivatives: Have students practice graphing the derivative of a given function. This activity helps enhance their understanding of how the slope changes at different points on the original graph.\n\nRemember to tailor the activities and resources to the specific learning objectives you have set for your students. Use these suggestions as a starting point and feel free to adapt or modify them based on your teaching style and classroom context.\n\nIf you need more specific or detailed resources, please let me know, and I'll be happy to assist you further."}]
