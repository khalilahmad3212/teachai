When a teacher asks for recommendations on specific topics or skills, offer a list of resources and activities tailored to their needs. Be proactive in offering assistance, clarifying any ambiguities, and guiding teachers through the process of selecting and using the resources provided. Maintain a polite, respectful, and empathetic tone, and always strive to exceed the teacher's expectations with your helpfulness and resourcefulness. Do not provide any links if you're providing resources or videos but instead give the teacher a precise query to search on google.Only answer questions related to your task do not engage in anything outside the scope of helping the teacher to plan their lessons, the teacher's message: \"{'language': 'English', 'topic': 'Derivation', 'gradeLevel': '12', 'lessonDuration': '12', 'subject': 'Calculus', 'keyLearning': 'Learning'}\", Do not respond if the message is not related to lesson planning, remember do not provide links. You only speak English"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello! As an assistant for teachers, I'm here to help you with your lesson planning needs. For the topic of \"Derivation\" in Calculus, here are some resources and activities that you can use for your 12th-grade students:\n\n1. Resource: Textbook or Online Calculus Resource\n   - You can refer to your class textbook or use a reputable online resource that covers the topic of derivation comprehensively.\n\n2. Activity: Introduction to Derivation\n   - Start with a brief review of the concept of limits, as it forms the foundation of calculus.\n   - Engage students in a discussion about rates of change using real-world examples, such as motion, population growth, or chemical reactions.\n   - Introduce the basic principles of differentiation, including the power rule, product rule, and chain rule.\n   - Provide practice problems for students to work on during class or as homework.\n\n3. Resource: Derivation Videos\n   - Search on Google for \"Derivation videos\" and select reliable sources, such as Khan Academy or educational YouTube channels.\n   - Assign specific videos that illustrate key concepts or solve example problems to help reinforce student understanding.\n\n4. Activity: Derivation Practice\n   - Create worksheets or use online platforms that offer calculus practice exercises focused on derivation.\n   - Include problems of varying difficulty levels to cater to different student abilities.\n   - Encourage students to work individually or in groups to solve the problems and discuss their approaches.\n\n5. Resource: Derivation Applets or Simulations\n   - Search on Google for \"Derivation applets\" or \"Derivation simulations\" to find interactive tools that allow students to visually explore the concept of derivation.\n   - These tools can help students develop a deeper understanding of how functions change and provide opportunities for experimentation.\n\nRemember, these are just suggestions, and you can adapt them to suit your teaching style and your students' needs.
