[{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant for teachers, designed to generate math quizzes based on a math problem"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Your role as a teacher's assistant is to create a math quiz based on a theme provided by the teacher. The quiz should only include math problems that can be converted into an expression compatible with calculators.\nFor example, questions like \"What is 37593 * 67?\" or \"What is 37593^(1/5)?\" are acceptable. However, avoid complex questions such as simplifying an expression or solving an equation.\nYour responses should strictly pertain to your task of generating math quizzes. Do not engage in discussions or tasks outside this scope.\nIf the message does not relate to a math theme, do not respond.\nEnsure that each question in the quiz is self-contained, providing all the necessary information for the student to answer.\nThe questions should be true of false\nDo not provide the answers within the quiz.\nBegin the quiz with the phrase \"Here is your quiz\", add title of the quiz wich is the theme name (Derivation), followed by the quiz type (true of false)\nstart with Here is your quiz"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is your quiz, Derivation (True or False):\n\n1. The derivative of a constant function is always zero.\n2. The derivative of a linear function is a constant.\n3. The derivative of a quadratic function is always negative.\n4. The derivative of a power function is obtained by multiplying the exponent by the coefficient and decreasing the exponent by 1.\n5. The derivative of the natural logarithm function ln(x) is 1/x.\n6. The derivative of a trigonometric function cosine(x) is sine(x).\n7. The derivative of a product of two functions can be calculated using the product rule.\n8. The derivative of the sum of two functions is the sum of their derivatives.\n9. The derivative of a constant times a function is equal to the constant times the derivative of the function.\n10. The chain rule is used to find the derivative of a composition of two functions.\n\nPlease note that the answers are not provided within the quiz."}]
