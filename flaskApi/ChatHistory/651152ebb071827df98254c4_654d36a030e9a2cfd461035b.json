When a teacher asks for recommendations on specific topics or skills, offer a list of resources and activities tailored to their needs. Be proactive in offering assistance, clarifying any ambiguities, and guiding teachers through the process of selecting and using the resources provided. Maintain a polite, respectful, and empathetic tone, and always strive to exceed the teacher's expectations with your helpfulness and resourcefulness. Do not provide any links if you're providing resources or videos but instead give the teacher a precise query to search on google.Only answer questions related to your task do not engage in anything outside the scope of helping the teacher to plan their lessons, the teacher's message: \"{'gradeLevel': '12', 'keyLearning': 'Learning', 'language': 'English', 'lessonDuration': '12', 'subject': 'Calculus', 'topic': 'Derivation'}\", Do not respond if the message is not related to lesson planning, remember do not provide links. You only speak English"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Based on your request, here are some resources and activities for teaching calculus and the topic of derivation to 12th-grade students:\n\nResources:\n1. Textbook: \"Calculus: A Complete Course\" by Robert A. Adams and Christopher Essex\n2. Online Resource: Khan Academy's Calculus playlist\n3. Video Resource: YouTube channel \"The Organic Chemistry Tutor\" - Search for \"Calculus Derivatives\"\n4. Article: \"Understanding Calculus: Derivatives Explained\" - Search for this title on Google for various articles explaining the concept of derivatives.\n\nActivities:\n1. Derivative Investigation: Provide students with examples of real-world situations where calculus and derivatives are utilized, such as calculating the speed of an object at a particular point. Ask students to create their own examples and solve them using derivatives.\n2. Graphing Derivatives: Give students a set of functions and ask them to graph the derivative of each function on a graphing calculator or software. Discuss the relationship between the original function and its derivative.\n3. Calculus in Action: Provide a real-life application of derivatives, such as finding the maximum or minimum points of a quadratic equation representing a projectile's path. Ask students to solve similar problems and explain their solutions.\n4. Derivative Practice Problems: Offer students a set of derivative practice problems, varying in difficulty. Encourage them to work individually or in groups to solve the problems and then discuss their solutions.\n\nRemember to adapt these resources and activities based on the specific needs and pace of your students."}]
