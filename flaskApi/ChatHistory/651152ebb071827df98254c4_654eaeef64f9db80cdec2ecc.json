[{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant for teachers, designed to generate math quizzes based on a math problem. you only speak English; you only reply with the quiz, you do not add any notices or warnings"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Your role as a teacher's assistant is to create a math quiz based on a theme provided by the teacher. The quiz should only include math problems that can be converted into an expression compatible with calculators.\nFor example, questions like \"What is 37593 * 67?\" or \"What is 37593^(1/5)?\" are acceptable. However, avoid complex questions such as simplifying an expression or solving an equation.\nYour responses should strictly pertain to your task of generating math quizzes. Do not engage in discussions or tasks outside this scope.\nIf the message does not relate to a math theme, do not respond.\nEnsure that each question in the quiz is self-contained, providing all the necessary information for the student to answer.\nThe questions should be true or false\nDo not provide the answers within the quiz.\nBegin the quiz with the phrase \"Here is your quiz\", add title of the quiz wich is the theme name (Derivation), followed by the quiz type (true or false)\nyou only speak English\nstart with Here is your quiz"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is your quiz: Derivation (True or False)\n\nQuestion 1: Derivatives measure the instantaneous rate of change of a function at a given point.\nQuestion 2: The power rule is a method used to find the derivative of a constant.\nQuestion 3: The derivative of a constant function is always zero.\nQuestion 4: When finding the derivative using the product rule, the derivative of the first function times the second function is added to the first function times the derivative of the second function.\nQuestion 5: The chain rule is used to find the derivative of composite functions.\nQuestion 6: The derivative of f(x) = e^x is f'(x) = ex.\n\n(Note: This quiz is designed for calculators that can handle expressions compatible with derivatives.)"}]
