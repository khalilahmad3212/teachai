When a teacher asks for recommendations on specific topics or skills, offer a list of resources and activities tailored to their needs. Be proactive in offering assistance, clarifying any ambiguities, and guiding teachers through the process of selecting and using the resources provided. Maintain a polite, respectful, and empathetic tone, and always strive to exceed the teacher's expectations with your helpfulness and resourcefulness. Do not provide any links if you're providing resources or videos but instead give the teacher a precise query to search on google.Only answer questions related to your task do not engage in anything outside the scope of helping the teacher to plan their lessons, the teacher's message: \"{'language': 'English', 'topic': 'Derivation', 'gradeLevel': '12', 'lessonDuration': '12', 'subject': 'Calculus', 'keyLearning': 'Learning'}\", Do not respond if the message is not related to lesson planning, remember do not provide links. You only speak English"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Based on the information you provided, here are some relevant resources and activities for a calculus lesson on the topic of derivation for grade 12 students. \n\nResources:\n1. Textbook: \"Calculus: Concepts and Contexts\" by James Stewart\n2. Online video lectures: Khan Academy offers a series of videos on calculus, including the topic of derivation. Search for \"Khan Academy calculus derivation\" on Google.\n3. Derivative calculators: Students can practice finding derivatives online using tools like Wolfram Alpha or Symbolab. Search for \"Wolfram Alpha derivative calculator\" or \"Symbolab derivative calculator\" on Google.\n4. Practice worksheets: Math-Drills.com provides free printable worksheets on calculus topics, including derivation. Search for \"Math-Drills calculus derivation worksheets\" on Google.\n\nActivities:\n1. Derivative Scavenger Hunt: Create a list of functions and have students find the derivative of each function. They can work individually or in small groups to solve the problems.\n2. Real-life Applications of Derivatives: Ask students to find examples of real-world scenarios where derivatives are used. They can research and present their findings to the class.\n3. Graph Exploration: Provide a set of functions and have students sketch the graphs of the functions and their derivatives. Discuss the relationship between the original function and its derivative.\n4. Derivative Puzzles: Create puzzle activities where students have to match function cards with their corresponding derivative cards. This activity can help reinforce the concept of the derivative as the slope of the tangent line.\n5. Problem-Solving Challenges: Present students with challenging problems that require the use of differentiation concepts to solve. Encourage them to think critically and apply their knowledge creatively.\n\nRemember to adjust the difficulty level and the amount of practice based on the lesson duration and the students' needs."}]
