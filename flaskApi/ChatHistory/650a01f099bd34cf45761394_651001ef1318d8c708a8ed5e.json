She explains that spoken English used in everyday life is different from the English taught in textbooks or schools. The instructor offers tips to help overcome this challenge, including downloading a free PDF with a detailed explanation of the lesson and a quiz to test understanding. She also emphasizes that joining the PDF Club will provide access to free weekly lesson materials and updates. In this video, the speaker discusses how native English speakers may differ from textbook English when speaking. The speaker gives examples of how spoken English and textbook English may vary in terms of grammar, such as the use of the passive voice and ending sentences with prepositions. The speaker also mentions that native speakers may bend certain rules in spoken English, like saying \"I haven't got any money\" instead of \"I don't have any money.\" The speaker shares personal experiences, including their mother's attempt to communicate with someone who didn't speak English, which resulted in humorous situations due to cultural and language differences. This video discusses three English language learning tips. The first tip is about the expression \"can't believe it,\" where the subject is often dropped and the contraction \"cannot\" is used instead. The second tip suggests getting feedback from qualified professionals, and the video recommends the language tutor platform, \"Language Talk.\" It offers high-quality teachers and personalized one-on-one sessions. The speaker also offers a $10 credit toward lessons for new sign-ups by using the code \"ewl 10.\" The third tip discusses connected speech, which refers to the practice of squishing words together to convey information quickly and efficiently. In this video, the speaker discusses connected speech in British English. They mention several key aspects, including ellipsis (the omission of certain sounds to make pronunciation more efficient), assimilation (when a sound changes to become more like a neighboring sound), intrusive \"r\" (when an \"r\" sound is inserted between two vowel sounds for smoother transition), linking \"r\" (when a word ending in \"r\" is followed by a word beginning with a vowel sound and the \"r\" is pronounced to connect the two words), and weak form (when certain words are often pronounced with a reduced or weak form, common with function words). The speaker in the video gives an overview of connected speech and how contractions are related to it. Contractions are the shortening of words by combining two or more words. Native speakers of English commonly use contractions in speech. The video provides examples of common contractions and mentions that there are also informal contractions used in casual conversations. Understanding contractions and learning idioms and slang can help improve comprehension skills when listening to native speakers. In this video, the speaker discusses the use of slang and idioms in English. They explain that while speaking in a direct, straightforward manner is ideal for understanding, native speakers often use slang and idioms to add color and character to their language. The speaker also provides examples of common slang terms, such as \"grub\" for unhealthy food, \"lurgy\" for feeling unwell, and \"dab hand\" for being skilled at something. Additionally, they mention the use of slang for attractiveness, such as \"fit\" and \"tipsy\" for being slightly drunk. The speaker concludes by offering a downloadable PDF with more slang and idioms for further exploration and expresses interest in creating a dedicated video on the topic if viewers are interested. In this video, the speaker provides tips and recommendations to improve English language skills. They mention a PDF resource and a discount offer on a platform called Langotalk. The speaker also invites viewers to explore the recently launched B1 B2 and C1 programs. The video ends with a goodbye message and music.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In this video, the instructor addresses the challenge of understanding native English speakers for English learners.
