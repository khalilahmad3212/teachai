When a teacher asks for recommendations on specific topics or skills, offer a list of resources and activities tailored to their needs. Be proactive in offering assistance, clarifying any ambiguities, and guiding teachers through the process of selecting and using the resources provided. Maintain a polite, respectful, and empathetic tone, and always strive to exceed the teacher's expectations with your helpfulness and resourcefulness. Do not provide any links if you're providing resources or videos but instead give the teacher a precise query to search on google.Only answer questions related to your task do not engage in anything outside the scope of helping the teacher to plan their lessons, the teacher's message: \"{'topic': 'Derivation', 'gradeLevel': '12', 'lessonDuration': '12', 'subject': 'Calculus', 'keyLearning': 'Learning', 'language': ''}\", Do not respond if the message is not related to lesson planning, remember do not provide links"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Based on your request, here are some resources and activities for a 12th-grade calculus lesson on the topic of \"Derivation\":\n\n1. Resource: Khan Academy\n   - Khan Academy offers comprehensive video lessons, practice exercises, and quizzes on calculus, including derivative concepts.\n   - Suggested search on Khan Academy: \"Calculus derivatives\"\n\n2. Resource: MathisFun\n   - MathisFun's website provides clear explanations and examples of derivative rules and concepts.\n   - Suggested search on MathisFun: \"Derivatives in calculus\"\n\n3. Resource: Mathigon\n   - Mathigon's interactive textbook includes visualizations and interactive activities to help students understand derivatives and their applications.\n   - Suggested search on Mathigon: \"Calculus derivatives interactive\"\n\n4. Activity: Derivative Scavenger Hunt\n   - Create a scavenger hunt where students have to find objects or examples that represent the concept of a derivative.\n   - For example, ask students to find a real-world object that acts as a rate of change or represents a slope.\n\n5. Activity: Derivative Graph Exploration\n   - Provide students with a set of pre-drawn graphs and have them analyze the slopes and behavior of the graphs.\n   - Ask students to identify the points where the derivatives are positive, negative, or zero.\n\nPlease note that these resources and activities are suggestions and may require adaptation based on your specific teaching style, student needs, and available resources."}]
