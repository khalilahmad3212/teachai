ok Lets concentrate on finishing the chatbots. 

These are the items I found from live website that need to be done for the chatbot section:


2. Follow up prompts on the right hand side can we only show this after the user has completed the input forms in chat and click submit? 
3. On the left hand side the categories under chatbots doesn’t show when I click on chatbots can we have the left nav “Category 1, Category 2 always fixed showing 

5. On the left hand side we need to include (see screenshot): 
    a. credits (this shows how much messages the user gets per day) 
    b. settings ( should be same as attached) 
    c.Log out

1. History button on chat is that meant to work? 
4. When you click on the chat - can the left hand side open the correct category showing all chatbots under that category? So for example click on lesson planner (which for example is in category 1) category 1 is open with the chatbots showing on the left.
